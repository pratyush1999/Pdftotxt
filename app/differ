I.                                                          A. RISK FACTORS. Standard Risk Factors: Investment in Mutual Fund Units involves investment risks such as trading volumes, settlement risk, liquidity risk, default risk including the possible loss of principal. As the price / value / interest rates of the securities in which the Scheme invests fluctuates, the value of your investment in the Scheme may go up or down depending on the various factors and forces affecting the capital markets and money markets. Past performance of the Sponsors and their affiliates/. AMC/ Mutual Fund does not guarantee future performance of the Scheme of the Mutual Fund. The name of the Scheme does not in any manner indicate either the quality of the Scheme or its future prospects and. The Sponsors are not responsible or liable for any loss resulting from the operation of the Scheme beyond the initial contribution of Rs. 1.lakh each made by them towards setting up the Fund. The present Scheme is not guaranteed or assured return. Scheme Specific Risk Factors. Some of the specific risk factors related to the Scheme include, but are not limited to the following: (i) Risk factors associated with investing in equities and equity related instruments. Equity shares and equity related instruments are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis. Investments in equity shares and equity related instruments involve a degree of risk and investors should not invest in the. Scheme unless they can afford to take the risks. Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and carry a larger amount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the exchanges. Investment in such securities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk. While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell these investments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. (ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed. Income Securities. The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money Market instruments, will be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. The NAV of the Scheme is expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be adversely affected by an increase in the level of interest rates. Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market, which may restrict the selling. ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term rating of the issuers. Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e. the risk of an issuers inability to meet interest or principal payments on its. obligations) or any other issues, which may have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial conditions of an issuer, changes in economic and political conditions in general, or changes in economic or and political conditions specific to an issuer, all of which are factors that may have an adverse impact on an issuers credit quality and security values. The Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit risk through in-house credit. analysis. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. The. Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit risk through in-house credit analysis. Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price-risk like any other fixed income security. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest rates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a function of the existing coupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest rates. The new level of interest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises new money and/or the price levels at which the market is already dealing in existing securities. The price-risk is not unique to Government Securities. It exists for all fixed income securities. However, Government Securities are unique in the sense that their credit risk generally remains. zero. Therefore, their prices are influenced only by movement in interest rates in the financial system. Different types of fixed income securities in which the. Scheme would invest as given in the Scheme Information. Document carry different levels and types of risk. Accordingly, the Scheme risk may increase or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e.g. corporate bonds carry a higher level of risk than Government securities. Further even among corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are comparatively less risky than AA rated bonds. The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated / unrated securities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the absolute level of risk of the portfolio. As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the security, these securities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to issuer default risk. Therefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The AMC may choose to invest in zero coupon securities that offer attractive. yields. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. Zero coupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that do not entitle the holder to any periodic payment of interest prior to maturity or a specified date when the securities begin paying current interest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face. values. The discount depends on the time remaining until. maturity or the date when securities begin paying current. interest. It also varies depending on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the perceived credit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are generally more volatile than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically. Schemes performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the investments held in the debt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal circumstances. Prepayment Risk: Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its securities before their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of such prepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in securities offering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme. Reinvestment Risk: This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received from the securities in the Scheme are reinvested. The additional income from reinvestment is the interest on interest component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows can be reinvested may be lower than that originally assumed. Settlement risk: Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. Delays or other problems in settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods when the assets of the. Scheme are uninvested and no return is earned thereon. The inability of the Scheme to make intended securities purchases, due to settlement problems, could cause the. Scheme to miss certain investment opportunities. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held in the Schemes portfolio, due to the absence of a well developed and liquid secondary market for debt securities, may result at times in potential losses to the Scheme in the event of a subsequent decline in the value of securities held in the Schemes portfolio. The Scheme at times may receive large number of redemption requests, leading to an asset-liability mismatch and therefore, requiring the investment manager to make a distress sale of the securities leading to realignment of the portfolio and consequently resulting in investment in lower yield instruments. (iii) Risk factors associated with investment in Tri-Party. Repo. The mutual fund is a member of securities segment and. Triparty Repo trade settlement of the Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL). All transactions of the mutual fund in government securities and in Tri-party Repo trades are settled centrally through the infrastructure and settlement systems provided by CCIL. thus reducing the settlement and counterparty risks considerably for transactions in the said segments. The members are required to contribute an amount as communicated by CCIL from time to time to the default fund maintained by CCIL as a part of the default waterfall (a loss mitigating measure of CCIL in case of default by any member in settling transactions routed through CCIL). As per the waterfall mechanism, after the defaulters margins and the defaulters contribution to the default fund have been appropriated, CCILs contribution is used to meet the losses. Post utilization of CCILs contribution if there is a residual loss, it is appropriated from the default fund contributions of the non-defaulting members. Thus the scheme is subject to risk of the initial margin and default fund contribution being invoked in the event of failure of any settlement obligations. In addition, the fund contribution is allowed to be used to meet the residual loss in case of default by the other clearing member (the defaulting member). CCIL shall maintain two separate Default Funds in respect of its Securities Segment, one with a view to meet losses arising out of any default by its members from outright and repo trades and the other for meeting losses arising out of any default by its members from Triparty Repo. trades. The mutual fund is exposed to the extent of its contribution to the default fund of CCIL, in the event that the contribution of the mutual fund is called upon to absorb settlement/default losses of another member by. CCIL, as a result the scheme may lose an amount equivalent to its contribution to the default fund. (iv) Risk factors associated with investing in Non- Convertible. Preference Shares. Credit Risk - Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will be unable to meet its obligation of payment of dividend and/ or redemption of principal amount on the due date. Further, for non-cumulative preference shares, issuer also has an option to not pay dividends on preference shares in case of inadequate profits in any year. Liquidity Risk - The preference shares generally have limited secondary market liquidity and thus we may be forced to hold the instrument till maturity. Unsecured in nature - Preference shares are unsecured in nature and rank lower than secured and unsecured debt in hierarchy of payments in case of liquidation. Thus there is significant risk of capital erosion in case the company goes into liquidation. (v) Related to HDFC Arbitrage Fund. A. The primary objective of the Fund Manager is to identify investment opportunities and to exploit price discrepancies in various markets. Identification and exploitation of the strategies to be pursued by the Fund Manager involve. uncertainty. No assurance can be given that Fund Manager will be able to locate investment opportunities or to correctly exploit price discrepancies in the capital markets. Reduction in mis-pricing opportunities between the cash market and Future and Options market may lead to lower level of activity affecting the returns. As the Scheme proposes to execute arbitrage transactions in various markets simultaneously, this may result in high portfolio turnover and, consequently, high transaction cost. There may be instances, where the price spread between cash and derivative market is insufficient to meet the cost of carry. In such situations, the fund manager due to lack of opportunities in the derivative market may not be able to outperform liquid / money market funds. Though the constituent stocks of most indices are typically liquid, liquidity differs across stock. Due to heterogeneity in liquidity in the capital market segment, trades on this segment do not get implemented instantly. This often makes arbitrage expensive, risky and difficult to structure. An equity oriented fund has been defined under the. Income Tax Act as a scheme of a mutual fund where the investible funds are invested in equity shares of domestic companies to the extent of more than 65.per cent of the total assets of such fund. The percentage of equity shareholding of the fund shall be computed with reference to the annual average of the monthly averages of the opening and closing figures. As per the asset allocation, under normal circumstances, the Scheme shall invest minimum 65% of its total assets in Equity and Equity Related instruments. However, under defensive circumstances, where the debt / money market instruments offer better returns than the arbitrage opportunities available in cash and derivatives segments of equity markets, then the investment manager may choose to have a lower equity exposure for a prolonged. period. In such a case, the fund may be regarded as a debt oriented fund as per extant Income Tax laws and consequently may not enjoy the favourable tax provisions available for equity oriented mutual funds in that particular financial year. In such situation, a Unitholder who has redeemed the units during that financial year may end up paying capital gain tax as applicable to a debt fund and consequently would also not be able to derive any benefit of STT paid at the time of redemption. Investors are requested to refer to the section Taxation on page 74. In view of the forgoing and individual nature of tax consequences, each Unit holder is advised to consult his / her own professional tax advisor. (vi) General Risk factors. Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances leading to delays in receipt of proceeds from sale of securities. The NAV of the Units of the Scheme can go up or down because of various factors that affect the capital markets in general. As the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme could, at times, be restricted by trading volumes and settlement periods, the time taken by the Mutual Fund for redemption of Units may be significant in the event of an inordinately large number of redemption requests or restructuring of the Scheme. In view of the above, the. Trustee has the right, in its sole discretion, to limit redemptions (including suspending redemptions) under certain circumstances, as described on Page 45.under Right to Restrict Redemption and / or Suspend. Redemption of the units.. At times, due to the forces and factors affecting the capital market, the Scheme may not be able to invest in securities falling within its investment objective resulting in holding the monies collected by it in cash or cash equivalent or invest the same in other permissible securities / investments amounting to substantial reduction in the earning capability of the Scheme. The Scheme may retain certain investments in cash or cash equivalents for its day-to-day liquidity requirements. Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and carry a larger amount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the exchanges or offer other exit options to the investor, including a put option. The AMC may choose to invest in unlisted securities that offer attractive returns. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. Investment strategy to be adopted by the Scheme may carry the risk of significant variance between the portfolio allocation of the Scheme and the Benchmark particularly over a short to medium term period. Performance of the Scheme may be affected by political, social, and economic developments, which may include changes in government policies, diplomatic conditions, and taxation policies. (vii) Risk factors associated with investing in Foreign. Securities. Currency Risk: Moving from Indian Rupee (INR) to any other currency entails currency risk. To the extent that the assets of the. Scheme will be invested in securities denominated in foreign currencies, the Indian Rupee equivalent of the net assets, distributions and income may be adversely affected by changes in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian Rupee. Interest Rate Risk: The pace and movement of interest rate cycles of various countries, though loosely co-related, can differ significantly. Hence by investing in securities of countries other than. India, the Scheme stand exposed to their interest rate. Investment in Foreign Debt Securities are subject to the risk of an issuers inability to meet interest and principal payments on its obligations and market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer. This is substantially reduced since the SEBI (MF) Regulations stipulate investments only in debt instruments with rating not below investment grade by accredited/registered credit rating agency. Taxation Risk: In addition to the disclosure related to taxation mentioned under section Special Consideration on Page 10, Investment in Foreign Securities poses additional challenges based on the tax laws of each respective country or. jurisdiction. The scheme may be subject to a higher level of taxes than originally anticipated and or dual taxation. The Scheme may be subject to withholding or other taxes on income and/or gains arising from its investment. portfolio. Further, such investments are exposed to risks associated with the changing / evolving tax / regulatory regimes of all the countries where the Scheme invests. All these may entail a higher outgo to the Scheme by way of taxes, transaction costs, fees etc. thus adversely impacting its NAV. resulting in lower returns to an Investor. Legal and Regulatory Risk: Legal and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Scheme which may adversely affect it. If any of the laws and regulations currently in effect should change or any new laws or regulations should be enacted, the legal requirements to which the Scheme and the investors may be subject could differ materially from current requirements and may materially and adversely affect the Scheme and the investors. Legislation/ Regulatory guidelines could also be imposed retrospectively. Country Risk: The Country risk arises from the inability of a country, to meet its financial obligations. It is the risk encompassing economic, social and political conditions in a foreign country, which might adversely affect foreign investors financial interests. In addition, country risks would include events such as introduction of extraordinary exchange controls, economic deterioration, bi-lateral conflict leading to immobilisation of the overseas financial assets and the prevalent tax laws of the respective jurisdiction for execution of trades or otherwise. To manage risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate exposure, the Mutual Fund may use derivatives for efficient portfolio management including hedging and in accordance with conditions as may be stipulated by. SEBI/ RBI from time to time. (viii) Risk factors associated with investing in. Derivatives. The AMC, on behalf of the Scheme may use various derivative products, from time to time, in an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unit holders. interest. Derivative products are specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analysis different from those associated with stocks and bonds. The use of a derivative requires an understanding not only of the underlying instrument but of the derivative itself. Other risks include, the risk of mispricing or improper valuation and the inability of derivatives to correlate perfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices. Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well as disproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the ability of the fund manager to identify such. opportunities. Identification and execution of the strategies to be pursued by the fund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund manager may not always be profitable. No assurance can be given that the fund manager will be able to identify or execute such strategies. The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the risks associated with. investing directly in securities and other traditional. The credit risk in derivative transaction is the risk that the counter party will default on its obligations and is generally low, as there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative transaction. Market Risk: Market movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives. Illiquidity risk: This is the risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due to lack of liquidity in the market. Additional Risk viz. Basis Risk associated with imperfect hedging using Interest Rate Futures (IRF): The imperfect correlation between the prices of securities in the portfolio and the IRF contract used to hedge part of the portfolio leads to basis risk. Thus, the loss on the portfolio may not exactly match the gain from the hedge position entered using the IRF. (vii) Risk factors associated with Securities Lending. As with other modes of extensions of credit, there are risks inherent to securities lending, including the risk of failure of the other party, in this case the approved intermediary, to comply with the terms of the agreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme and the approved. intermediary. Such failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the collateral put up by the borrower of the securities, the inability of the approved intermediary to return the securities deposited by the lender and the possible loss of any corporate benefits accruing to the lender from the securities deposited with the approved intermediary. (ix) Risk factors associated with investing in Securitised. Debt. The Risks involved in Securitised Papers described below are the principal ones and does not represent that the statement of risks set out hereunder is exhaustive. Limited Liquidity & Price Risk. There is no assurance that a deep secondary market will develop for the Certificates. This could limit the ability of the investor to resell them. Limited Recourse, Delinquency and Credit Risk. The Credit Enhancement stipulated represents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These Certificates represent an undivided beneficial interest in the underlying receivables and do not represent an obligation of either the Issuer or the Seller or the originator, or the parent or any affiliate of the Seller, Issuer and Originator. No financial recourse is available to the Certificate Holders against the Investors. Representative. Delinquencies and credit losses may cause depletion of the amount available under the Credit. Enhancement and thereby the Investor Payouts to the. Certificate Holders may get affected if the amount available in the Credit Enhancement facility is not enough to cover. the shortfall. On persistent default of a Obligor to repay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess and sell the. Asset. However many factors may affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such Asset or the length of time required to realise the sale proceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at which such Asset may be sold may be lower than the amount due from that Obligor. Risks due to possible prepayments and Charge. Offs. In the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in tenor and yield. Also, any Charge Offs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass. Through Certificates (PTCs). Bankruptcy of the Swap Bank. If the Swap Bank, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings then an Investor could experience losses or delays in the payments due under the Interest Rate Swap. Risk of Co-mingling. With respect to the Certificates, the Servicer will deposit all payments received from the Obligors into the Collection. Account. However, there could be a time gap between collection by a Servicer and depositing the same into the. Collection account especially considering that some of the collections may be in the form of cash. In this interim period, collections from the Loan Agreements may not be segregated from other funds of originator. If originator in its capacity as Servicer fails to remit such funds due to. Investors, the Investors may be exposed to a potential loss. (x)    Risk factors associated with processing of transaction through Stock Exchange Mechanism. The trading mechanism introduced by the stock exchange(s) is configured to accept and process transactions for mutual fund units in both Physical and Demat Form. The allotment and/or redemption of Units through NSE and/or BSE or any other recognised stock exchange(s), on any Business Day will depend upon the modalities of processing viz. collection of application form, order processing/settlement, etc. upon which the Fund has no control. Moreover, transactions conducted through the stock exchange mechanism shall be governed by the operating guidelines and directives issued by respective recognized stock exchange(s). (xi) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs: Price Risk: Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis owing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in general market conditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and Infrastructure sectors, level of interest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures. Interest Rate Risk: Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate. risk. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase. Credit Risk: Credit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest payment or even on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/. Instruments of REITs and InvITs are likely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not necessarily be pre scheduled. Liquidity Risk: This refers to the ease with which securities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There is no assurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there would be time when trading in the units could be infrequent. The subsequent valuation of illiquid units may reflect a discount from the market price of comparable securities/instruments for which a liquid market exists. As these products are new to the market they are likely to be exposed to liquidity risk. Reinvestment Risk: Investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there could be repatriation of funds by the Trusts in form of buyback of units or dividend pay-outs, etc. Consequently, the proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns. Legal and Regulatory Risk. The regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs comprises a relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and enforcement by regulators and courts involves uncertainties. Presently, it is difficult to forecast as to how any new laws, regulations or standards or future amendments will affect the issuers of REITs/InvITs and the sector as a whole. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that the regulatory system will not change in a way that will impair the ability of the Issuers to comply with the regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively or make distributions. B. REQUIREMENT OF MINIMUM INVESTORS IN. THE SCHEME. The Scheme shall have a minimum of 20.investors and no single investor shall account for more than 25% of the corpus of the Scheme (at portfolio level). The two conditions mentioned above shall be complied within each subsequent calendar quarter, on an average basis, as specified by SEBI.

The price and yield on various debt instruments fluctuate from time to time depending upon the macro economic situation, inflation rate, overall liquidity position, foreign exchange scenario etc. Also, the price and yield vary according to maturity profile, credit risk etc. Generally, for instruments issued by a non-Government entity (corporate / PSU bonds), the yield is higher than the yield on. Government Security with corresponding maturity. The difference, known as credit spread, depends on the credit rating of the entity. Overseas Debt Market. The nature and number of debt instruments available in international debt markets is very wide. In terms of diverse instruments as well as liquidity, overseas debt markets offer great depth and are extremely well developed. Investment in international debt greatly expands the universe of top quality debt, which is no longer restricted to the limited papers available in the domestic debt market. The higher rated overseas sovereign, quasi-government and corporate debt offer lower default risk in addition to offering a high degree of liquidity since these are traded across major international. markets. Investments in rated international debt offer multiple benefits of risk reduction, a much wider universe of top quality debt and also potential gains from currency movements. Investments in international markets are most often in U.S. dollars, though the Euro, Pound Sterling and the Yen are also major currencies. Though this market is geographically well spread across global financial centres, the markets in the U.S., European Union and London offer the most liquidity and depth of instruments. Besides factors specific to the country / issuer, international bond prices are influenced to a large extent by a number of other factors. chief among these are the international economic outlook, changes in interest rates in major economies, trading volumes in overseas markets, cross currency movements among major currencies, rating changes of countries / corporations and major political changes globally. The approximate yields to maturity in the US Bond Market are as follows: Corporate Bond yields rate (%) (As at March 29, 2019) (Source - Bloomberg).

Pursuant to SEBI. Circular No. MFD/CIR/9/120/2000.dated November 24, 2000, the AMC may constitute committee(s) to approve proposals for investments in unrated debt instruments. The AMC Board and the Trustee shall approve the detailed parameters for such investments. The details of such investments would be communicated by the AMC to the. Trustee in their periodical reports. It would also be clearly mentioned in the reports, how the parameters have been complied with. However, in case any unrated debt security does not fall under the parameters, the prior approval of Board of AMC and Trustee shall be sought. Investment in debt instruments shall generally have a low risk profile and those in money market instruments shall have an even lower risk profile. The maturity profile of debt instruments will be selected in accordance with the AMCs view regarding current market conditions, interest rate outlook and the stability of ratings. Investments in Debt and Money Market Instruments will be as per the limits specified in the asset allocation table(s) of the Scheme, subject to permissible limits laid under SEBI. (MF) Regulations. Investments in both equity and debt will be made through secondary market purchases, initial public offers, other public offers, placements and right offers (including. renunciation). The securities could be listed, unlisted, privately placed, secured / unsecured, rated / unrated. Pending deployment as per investment objective, the moneys under the Scheme may be parked in short-term deposits of Scheduled Commercial Banks. The Scheme shall abide by the guidelines for parking of funds in short term deposits as per SEBI Circular No. SEBI/. IMD/CIR No. 1/91171/07.dated April 16, 2007, as may be amended from to time. For details refer What are the Investment Restrictions on Page 34. The Scheme may invest in other schemes managed by the. AMC or in the schemes of any other mutual funds, provided it is in conformity with the investment objectives of the Scheme and in terms of the prevailing SEBI (MF). Regulations. As per the SEBI (MF) Regulations, no investment management fees will be charged for such investments and the aggregate inter scheme investment made by all the schemes of HDFC Mutual Fund or in the schemes of other mutual funds shall not exceed 5% of the net asset value of the HDFC Mutual Fund. Investment in Foreign Securities. The Scheme may also invest in suitable investment avenues in overseas financial markets for the purpose of diversification, commensurate with the Scheme objectives and subject to the provisions of SEBI Circular No.SEBI/. IMD/ CIR No.7/104753/07.dated September 26, 2007.as may be amended from time to time and any other requirements as may be stipulated by SEBI/RBI from time to time. Towards this end, the Mutual Fund may also appoint overseas investment advisors and other service providers, as and when permissible under the regulations. The Scheme may, in terms of its investment objectives with the approval of SEBI/RBI invest in following Foreign. Securities: i.   ADRs/ GDRs issued by Indian or foreign companies. ii.

Mutual funds can make overseas investments [as stated in point (i) to (x) above] subject to a maximum of US $300.million (limit per mutual fund subject to overall limit of. US $7.billion) or such limits as may be prescribed by SEBI from time to time. Subject to the approval of the RBI / SEBI and conditions as may be prescribed by them, the Mutual Fund may open one or more foreign currency accounts abroad either directly, or through the custodian/sub-custodian, to facilitate investments and to enter into/deal in forward currency contracts, currency futures, index options, index futures, interest rate futures/swaps, currency options for the purpose of hedging the risks of assets of a portfolio or for its efficient management. The Mutual Fund may, where necessary appoint intermediaries as sub-managers, sub-custodians, etc. for managing and administering such investments. The appointment of such intermediaries shall be in accordance with the applicable requirements of SEBI and within the permissible ceilings of expenses as stated under Regulation 52.of SEBI (MF) Regulations. Investment in Securitised Debt. A securitisation transaction involves sale of receivables by the originator (a bank, non-banking finance company, housing finance company, or a manufacturing/service company) to a. Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), typically set up in the form of a trust. Investors are issued rated Pass Through Certificates. (PTCs), the proceeds of which are paid as consideration to the. originator. In this manner, the originator, by selling his loan receivables to an SPV, receives consideration from investors much before the maturity of the underlying loans. Investors are paid from the collections of the underlying loans from. borrowers. Typically, the transaction is provided with a limited amount of credit enhancement (as stipulated by the rating. agency for a target rating), which provides protection to investors against defaults by the underlying borrowers. Generally available asset classes for securitisation in India are: Commercial vehicles. Auto and two wheeler pools. Mortgage pools (residential housing loans). Personal loan, credit card and other retail loans. Corporate loans/receivables. Investment / Risk Mitigation Strategy. 1.   Risk profile of securitised debt vis--vis risk appetite of the Scheme(s). The risk profile of securitised debt is generally at par with the risk profile of other debt securities at the same level of credit. rating. Securitised debt offers additional income (spread) over debt security of similar rating and maturity, which enables the scheme to optimize its income without taking any additional credit risk. Securitised debt is generally less liquid, however, investment in securitised debt is made to maintain a diversified portfolio of debt securities that optimizes return without increasing the overall risk profile of the Scheme. 2.   Policy relating to originators based on nature of originator, track record, NPAs, losses in earlier securitised debt, etc. The originator is an entity (like banks, non-banking finance companies, corporates etc), which has initially provided the loan & is also generally responsible for servicing the loans. The schemes will invest in securitised debt of originators with at least investment grade credit rating and established track. record. A detailed evaluation of originator is done before the investment is made in securitised debt of any originator on various parameters given below: Track record. The investment in securitised debt is done based on origination and underwriting process and capabilities of the originator, overview of corporate structure, group to which they belong, experience of the company in the business & how long they have been in the business, financial condition of the company, credit rating, past performance of similar pools by the originator, Willingness to pay through credit enhancement facilities. Credit enhancement is provided by the originator, as indicated by rating agencies, so as to adequately cover the defaults and acts as a risk mitigation measure. The size of the credit enhancement as indicated by rating agency depends on the originators track record, past delinquencies, pattern of the portfolio & characteristics of the pool vis-a-vis of the portfolio, nature of the asset class. Ability to pay. The quality of the origination impacts the performance of the underlying asset & thus originators with strong systems and processes in place can eliminate poor quality assets. A robust risk management system of the originator and availability of. MIS reports on timely basis, results in creation of strong asset. Business Risk Assessment. The business risk assessment of originator / underlying borrower also includes detailed credit assessment wherein following factors are also considered: 1.    Outlook for the economy (domestic and global) 2.    Outlook for the industry 3.    Company specific factors. In addition, a detailed review and assessment of rating rationale is done along with interactions with the company as well as the rating agency. All investment in securitised debt is done after taking into account, the Critical Evaluation Parameters (for pool loan and single loan securitisation transactions) regarding the originator / underlying issuer as mentioned below: Default track record/ frequent alteration of redemption conditions / covenants. High leverage ratios of the ultimate borrower (for single- sell downs) - both on a standalone basis as well on a consolidated level/ group level. Higher proportion of reschedulement of underlying assets of the pool or loan, as the case may be. Higher proportion of overdue assets of the pool or the underlying loan, as the case may be. Poor reputation in market. Insufficient track record of servicing of the pool or the loan, as the case may be. 3.   Risk mitigation strategies for investments with each kind of originator. Investments are based on assessment of following parameters, so as to mitigate risk associated with such investment: a.   Credit quality, size and reach of the originator. b.   Nature of receivables/asset category i.e. cars, construction equipment, commercial vehicles, personal loans etc. c.   Collection process, infrastructure and follow-up mechanism. d.   Quality of MIS. e.   Credit cum liquidity enhancement. f.   Credit appraisal norms of originator. g.   Asset Quality - portfolio delinquency levels. h.   Past performance of rated pools. i.   Pool Characteristics - seasoning, Loan-to-value ratios, geographic diversity etc. 4.   The level of diversification with respect to the underlying assets, and risk mitigation measures for less diversified investments. Diversification of underlying assets is achieved through a) prudent mix of asset categories - i.e. cars (new, used), commercial vehicles, construction equipment, unsecured loans to individuals or small & medium enterprises b) total number of contracts in a pool c) average ticket size of loans and d) geographical distribution. Risk mitigation measures for less diversified investments in pools is accomplished through the size of credit enhancement, seasoning or loan to value ratios. Construction. Equipment. (including cash, guarantees, excess interest spread, subordinate tranche). exposure range %. NA - Not Applicable. Information in the table above is based on current scenario and is subject to change depending upon the change in related. Notes: A. In case of securitised debt with underlying being single loan, the investment limit applicable to the underlying borrower is considered. B.   Other investment will be decided on a case to case basis. In case of asset backed pools (ABS), evaluation of the pool assets is done considering the following factors: (Refer the table above which illustrates the averages of parameters considered while selecting the pool). Size of the loan. Average original maturity of the pool. Loan to Value Ratio. Average seasoning of the pool. Default rate distribution. Geographical Distribution. Credit enhancement facility. Liquid facility. Structure of the pool. 5.   Minimum retention period of the debt by originator prior to securitisation. The illustrative average seasoning of the debt by originator prior to securitisation is given above in table (Refer Point 4). Minimum retention period of the debt by originator prior to securitisation in the case of asset pools is in the form of seasoning of loans to various asset classes (cars, commercial vehicles, etc.) and generally varies from one month to six months depending on the nature of asset. While minimum retention percentage by originator is not prescribed, any amount retained by the originator through subordination is viewed positively at the time of making investment and generally varies from 5% to 10%. 7.    The mechanism to tackle conflict of interest when the mutual fund invests in securitised debt of an originator and the originator in turn makes investments in that particular scheme of the fund. All proposals for investment in securitised debt are evaluated by the credit analyst based on several parameters such as nature of underlying asset category, pool characteristics, asset quality, credit rating of the securitisation transaction, and credit cum liquidity enhancement available. Investment in securitised debt in any scheme is made by the respective fund manager in line with the investment objective of that scheme. 8.    The resources and mechanism of individual risk assessment with the AMC for monitoring investment in securitised debt (in general). Investment in securitised debt is monitored regularly with regards to its performance on various parameters such as collection efficiency, delinquencies, prepayments and utilization of credit enhancement. Information on these parameters is available through monthly reports from Pool Trustees and through information disseminated by the rating agencies. Monthly performance report is released by the credit analyst to the fund management team and the fund management team periodically reviews the same. n    Trading in Derivatives. The Scheme may invest in derivatives based on the opportunities available subject to the guidelines provided by SEBI from time to time and in line with the overall investment objective of the. Scheme. The Scheme may invest in derivative instruments like. Futures, Options, Interest Rate Swaps, Forward Rate Agreements, and such other derivative instruments as may be permitted by. SEBI from time to time. Derivative investments may be undertaken to hedge the portfolio, re-balance the same or to undertake any other strategy as permitted under SEBI (MF) Regulations from time to time. Hedging could be perfect or imperfect. In case the Scheme has investment in foreign securities, then it may hedge the exchange rate risk on all receivables on these instruments through various derivative products such as forwards, currency futures/ options, etc. Derivatives can be traded over the exchange or can be structured between two counter-parties. Those transacted over the exchange are called Exchange Traded derivatives whereas the other category is referred to as OTC (Over the Counter) derivatives. Some of the differences of these two derivative categories are as under: Exchange traded derivatives: These are quoted on the exchanges like any other traded asset class. The most common amongst these are the Index Futures, Index Options, Stock Futures and. Options on individual equities / securities. The basic form of the futures contract is similar to that of the forward contract, a futures contract obligates its owner to purchase a specified asset at a specified exercise price on the contract maturity date. Futures are cash-settled and are traded only in organised exchanges. Exchange traded derivatives are standardised in terms of amount and delivery date. Standardisation and transparency generally ensures a liquid market together with narrower spreads. On the other hand, for delivery dates far in the future, there may be insufficient liquidity in the futures market whereas an OTC price may be available. OTC derivatives: OTC derivatives require the two parties engaging in a derivatives transaction to come together through process of negotiation. It is a derivative that is customised in terms of structure, amount, tenor, underlying assets, collateral. etc. Some of the common examples are interest rate and currency swaps, Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) etc. Exposure to Derivatives. Please refer to Page 18.for the details of maximum exposure to investment in Derivatives by the Scheme. Position Limits. The position limits for trading in derivatives by Mutual Funds specified by SEBI vide SEBI Circular No. DNPD/Cir-29/2005. dated September 14, 2005, SEBI Circular No. DNPD/Cir -30/ 2006.dated January 20, 2006.and SEBI Circular No. SEBI/. DNPD/Cir-31/2006.dated September 22, 2006.are as follows: i.   Position limit for Mutual Funds in index options contracts. a.   The Mutual Fund position limit in all index options contracts on a particular underlying index shall be.

This limit would be applicable on open positions in all options contracts on a particular underlying index. ii.   Position limit for Mutual Funds in index futures contracts. a.   The Mutual Fund position limit in all index futures contracts on a particular underlying index shall be Rs. 500.crore or 15% of the total open interest of the market in index futures, whichever is higher, per Stock Exchange. b.   This limit would be applicable on open positions in all futures contracts on a particular underlying. iii. Additional position limit for hedging. In addition to the position limits at point (i) and (ii) above, Mutual Funds may take exposure in equity index derivatives subject to the following limits : 1.   Short positions in index derivatives (short futures, short calls and long puts) shall not exceed (in notional. value) the Mutual Funds holding of stocks. 2.   Long positions in index derivatives (long futures, long calls and short puts) shall not exceed (in notional. value) the Mutual Funds holding of cash, government securities, T-Bills and similar instruments. iv. Position limit for Mutual Funds for stock based derivative contracts. The Mutual Fund position limit in a derivative contract on a particular underlying stock, i.e. stock option contracts and stock futures contracts will be as follows :- 1.    The combined futures and options position limit shall be 20% of the applicable Market Wide Position Limit. (MWPL). v.    Position limit for each scheme of a Mutual Fund. The scheme-wise position limit requirements shall be : 1.   For stock option and stock futures contracts, the gross open position across all derivative contracts on a particular underlying stock of a scheme of a mutual fund shall not exceed the higher of: 1% of the free float market capitalization (in terms of number of shares). or 5% of the open interest in the derivative contracts on a particular underlying stock (in terms of number of. contracts). 2.   This position limits shall be applicable on the combined position in all derivative contracts on an underlying stock at a Stock Exchange. 3.   For index based contracts, Mutual Funds shall disclose the total open interest held by its scheme or all schemes put together in a particular underlying index, if such open interest equals to or exceeds 15% of the open interest of all derivative contracts on that underlying index. Exposure Limits. The exposure limits for trading in derivatives by Mutual. Funds specified by SEBI vide its Circular No. Cir/IMD/DF/ 11/2010.dated August 18, 2010.are as follows: 1.   The cumulative gross exposure through equity, debt and derivative positions should not exceed 100% of the net assets of the scheme. 2.   Mutual Funds shall not write options or purchase instruments with em-bedded written options. 3.   The total exposure related to option premium paid must not exceed 20% of the net assets of the scheme. 4.   Cash or cash equivalents with residual maturity of. 5.   Exposure due to hedging positions may not be included in the above mentioned limits subject to the following: a.   Hedging positions are the derivative positions that reduce possible losses on an existing position in securities and till the existing position remains. b.   Hedging positions cannot be taken for existing derivative positions. Exposure due to such positions shall have to be added and treated under limits mentioned in Point 1. c.   Any derivative instrument used to hedge has the same underlying security as the existing position being hedged. d.   The quantity of underlying associated with the derivative position taken for hedging purposes does not exceed the quantity of the existing position against which hedge has been taken. 6.   Mutual Funds may enter into plain vanilla interest rate swaps for hedging purposes. The counter party in such transactions has to be an entity recognized as a market maker by RBI. Further, the value of the notional principal in such cases must not exceed the value of respective existing assets being hedged by the scheme. Exposure to a single counterparty in such transactions should not exceed 10% of the net assets of the scheme. 7.   Exposure due to derivative positions taken for hedging purposes in excess of the underlying position against which the hedging position has been taken, shall be treated under the limits mentioned in point 1. 8.   Definition of Exposure in case of Derivative Positions. Each position taken in derivatives shall have an associated exposure as defined under. Exposure is the maximum possible loss that may occur on a. position. However, certain derivative positions may theoretically have unlimited possible loss. Exposure in derivative positions shall be computed as follows: Exposure limits on Interest Rate Futures (IRF). The exposure limits for trading in Interest Rate Futures. (IRFs) by Mutual Funds specified by SEBI vide its Circular. No. SEBI/HO/IMD/DF2/CIR/P/2017/109.dated September 27, 2017.are as follows: i.    To reduce interest rate risk in a debt portfolio, mutual funds may hedge the portfolio or part of the portfolio (including one or more securities) on weighted average modified duration basis by using Interest Rate Futures. (IRFs). The maximum extent of short position that may be taken in IRFs to hedge interest rate risk of the portfolio or part of the portfolio, is as per the formula given below: (Portfolio Modified Duration. Market Value of the Portfolio) (Futures Modified Duration Futures Price/PAR). ii.   In case the IRF used for hedging the interest rate risk has different underlying security(s) than the existing position being hedged, it would result in imperfect. iii. Imperfect hedging using IRFs may be considered to be exempted from the gross exposure, upto maximum of 20% of the net assets of the scheme, subject to the following: a.    Exposure to IRFs is created only for hedging the interest rate risk based on the weighted average modified duration of the bond portfolio or part of the. b.    Mutual Funds are permitted to resort to imperfect hedging, without it being considered under the gross exposure limits, if and only if, the correlation between the portfolio or part of the portfolio (excluding the hedged portions, if any) and the IRF is atleast 0.at the time of initiation of hedge. In case of any subsequent deviation from the correlation criteria, the same may be rebalanced within 5.working days and if not rebalanced within the timeline, the derivative positions created for hedging shall be considered under the gross exposure computed in terms of SEBI circular dated August 18, 2010. The correlation should be calculated for a period of last 90.days. Explanation: If the fund manager intends to do imperfect hedging upto 15% of the portfolio using IRFs on weighted average modified duration basis, either of the following conditions need to be complied with: i.   The correlation for past 90.days between the portfolio and the IRF is at least 0.or. ii. The correlation for past 90.days between the part of the portfolio (excluding the hedged portions, if any). i.e. at least 15% of the net asset of the scheme (including one or more securities) and the IRF is at least 0. c. At no point of time, the net modified duration of part of the portfolio being hedged should be negative. d. The portion of imperfect hedging in excess of 20% of the net assets of the scheme should be considered as creating exposure and shall be included in the computation of gross exposure in terms of SEBI circular. dated August 18, 2010. E. WHAT ARE THE INVESTMENT STRATEGIES?                                     Scheme will seek to generate income through arbitrage opportunities such as Index/Stock Spot vs Index/Stock Futures or Index Futures vs Stock Futures or Future of same stock with different expiry months or ADR/GDR vs underlying shares etc. The Scheme may use corporate action or event driven strategy where there is a potential opportunity for arbitrage in cash or derivate market such as dividend arbitrage or buy-back arbitrage or merger etc. The Scheme would carry out simple strategies, which would be to take offsetting positions on various markets simultaneously across various asset classes. The overall risk the Scheme would carry would be that of being market neutral. The Scheme would not attempt to leverage or have short positions. Investment in Debt securities (including securitised debt) and money market instruments will be as per the limits in the asset allocation table of the Scheme, subject to permissible limits laid under SEBI (MF) Regulations. Investment in debt securities. Subject to the Regulations and the applicable guidelines, the. Scheme may, engage in Stock Lending activities. The Scheme may also invest in the hybrid securities viz. units of REITs and InvITs for diversification and subject to necessary stipulations by SEBI from time to time. The Scheme may also invest in the schemes of Mutual Funds. Though every endeavour will be made to achieve the objective of the Scheme, the AMC/ Sponsors/Trustee do not guarantee that the investment objective of the Scheme will be achieved. No guaranteed returns are being offered under the Scheme. Risk Control. Investments made from the net assets of the Scheme would be in accordance with the investment objective of the Scheme and the provisions of the SEBI (MF) Regulations. The AMC will strive to achieve the investment objective by way of a judicious portfolio mix comprising of Debt and Money Market Instruments and equity/ equity related instruments. Risk Mitigation measures for investments in equity / equity related and debt instruments. In the event of inadequate arbitrage opportunities or inadequate liquidity in those securities, the Scheme provides for allocating upto 100% of assets in debt and money/ market securities for generating regular income. Investments in debt / money market securities would be undertaken after assessing the associated credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Scheme seeks to manage the duration of debt assets on a proactive basis to manage interest rate risks and to optimise returns. A credit evaluation of each debt exposure would be. undertaken. This would also consider the credit ratings given to the instrument by recognised rating agencies. Investments in debt / money market securities would normally be undertaken in instruments that have been assigned high investment grade ratings by any of the recognised rating agencies. Unrated investments, if any, would require specific approval from a committee constituted for the purpose. Credit Evaluation Policy. The credit evaluation policy of the AMC entails evaluation of credit fundamentals of each investment opportunity. Some of the factors that are evaluated inter-alia may include outlook on the sector, parentage, quality of management, and overall financial strength of the credit. The AMC utilises ratings of. recognized rating agencies as an input in the credit evaluation. process. Investments in bonds and debenture are usually in instruments that have been assigned high investment grade ratings by a recognized rating agency. In line with SEBI Circular No. MFD/CIR/9/120/ 2000.dated. November 24, 2000, the AMC may constitute committee(s) to approve proposals for investments in unrated instruments. The. AMC Board and the Trustee shall approve the detailed parameters for such investments. The details of such investmentswould be communicated by the AMC to the Trustee in their periodical reports. It would also be clearly mentioned in the reports, how the parameters have been complied with. However, in case any security does not fall under the parameters, the prior approval of Board of AMC and Trustee shall be. Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to sell / liquidate a security at short notice at prevailing market prices or without incurring impact cost. While government bonds, money market instruments and shorter maturity instruments are generally easier to sell, corporate bonds and other instruments typically face higher liquidity. risk. Further, higher rated securities normally are more liquid compared to lower rated securities. As a result, different portfolios will face different levels of liquidity risk based on the underlying portfolio composition. Some of the strategies to reduce liquidity risk are creating portfolios that are diversified across maturities, ratings, types of securities, etc. in line with the fund objectives, regulations and investment strategy. Credit Risk:Lower rated securities have a higher credit risk compared to higher rated securities. Hence, credit risk faced by different schemes will be different based on the underlying portfolio / investment strategy. To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in-depth credit evaluation of each issuer will be undertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Each of the scheme/ portfolio will endeavour to maintain adequate diversification across issuers / sectors in line with scheme objectives, regulations and investment strategy. Unrated investments, if any, would require specific approval from a committee constituted for the purpose. Debt Derivatives Risk: The AMC has provision for using derivative instruments for portfolio balancing and hedging. purposes. Interest Rate Swaps will be done with approved counter parties under pre approved ISDA agreements. Mark to Market of swaps, netting off of cash flow and default provision clauses will be provided as per standard practice on a reciprocal basis. Interest Rate Swaps and other derivative instruments will be used as per local (RBI and SEBI) regulatory guidelines. Interest Rate Risk:Interest rate risk is the risk of change in the NAVs due to change in overall market yields. The change in value of a security, for a given change in yield, is higher for a security with higher duration and vice versa. Hence portfolios with higher duration will have higher. volatility. The AMC shall strive to actively manage the duration of the respective funds based on the prevailing market conditions / outlook of interest rates, keeping in mind the scheme objectives, investment strategy and applicable regulations. Concentration Risk: The AMC will attempt to mitigate this risk by maintaining adequate diversification across issuers/ sectors / instrument type in line with the scheme objectives, investment strategy and applicable regulations. This will also be managed by keeping prudent investment limits. on any particular industry or issuer or issuer group based on the size, credit profile, etc. to reduce issuer or industry specific risk. Risk Mitigation measures for investments in Non-Convertible. Preference Shares: Credit Risk - To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in-depth credit evaluation of each issuer will be undertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Liquidity Risk - The Fund endeavours to invest in preference shares of those companies which have relatively better market acceptability amongst market participants that increases the probability of secondary sale in case an exit from the investment is required. Unsecured in nature - The Fund endeavours to mitigate this risk by exercising due diligence while assessing the business, financial and management risks of the company before investing. While these measures are expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance that these risks would be completely eliminated. Strategies for Investment in Derivatives as per derivative strategy of the Scheme. Basic Structure of an Index Future. Index Futures are instruments designed to give exposure to the equity market indices. BSE Limited and the National Stock. Exchange of India Limited have started trading in index futures of 1, 2.and 3.month maturities. The pricing of an index future is the function of the underlying index and short term interest. Example: Assumptions: 1.month BSE 30.Future. Spot Index: 4900. Future Price on day 1: 4920. Fund buys 10,000.futures contracts.                                                                       strategy of taking a long position in index futures increases the exposure to the market. The long position is positively correlated with the market. However, there is no assurance that the stocks in the portfolio and the index behave in the same manner and thus this strategy may not provide gains perfectly aligned to the movement in the index. The long position will have as much loss / gain as in the underlying index. e.g. if the index appreciates by 10%, the index future value rises by 10%. However, this is true. On Date of settlement. Future price = Closing spot price = 4950. Profits for the Fund = (4950-4920)10000.= Rs. 300,000.+ interest for the 1.month period. Please note that the above example is given for illustration purposes only. The net impact for the Fund will be in terms of the difference between the closing price of the index and cost price (ignoring margins for the sake of simplicity) plus interest costs on funds that would otherwise be invested in stocks comprising the. index. The risks associated with index futures are similar to those associated with equity investments. Additional risks could be on account of illiquidity and/or mis pricing of the future at any time during the life of the contract. The strategies below are given for illustration purposes only. Some of the strategies involving derivatives that may be used by the Investment Manager, with an aim to protect capital and enhance returns include : Strategy Number 1. Using Index Futures to increase percentage investment in equities. This strategy will be used for the purpose of generating returns on idle cash, pending its investment in equities. The Scheme is subject to daily flows. There may be a time lag between the inflow of funds and their deployment in. stocks. If so desired, the scheme would be able to take immediate exposure to equities via index futures. The position in index futures may be reversed in a phased manner, as the funds are deployed in the equity markets. Example: The scheme has a corpus of Rs. 50.crore and there is an inflow of Rs. 5.crore in a day. The AMC may buy index futures contracts of a value of Rs. 5.crore. Later as the money is deployed in the underlying equities, the value of the index futures contracts can be suitably reduced. quoted price of the futures contract may be different from the gain/ loss due to the movement of the underlying. index. This is called the basis risk. While futures markets are typically more liquid than the underlying cash market, there can be no assurance that ready liquidity would exist at all points in time, for the. Scheme to purchase or close out a specific futures contract. Strategy Number 2. Downside Protection Using Stock Put. As a stock hedging strategy, the purchase of a put option on an underlying stock held would lead to a capping of the loss in value of the stock in the event of a material decline in the stocks price. The purchase of a put option against a stock holding in the scheme gives the scheme the option of selling the stock to the writer of the put at the predetermined level of the Put Option, called the strike price. If the stock falls below this level, the downside for the scheme is protected as it has already locked into the selling price. In case of a fall in the stocks price below the strike price, the value of the Put Option appreciates, approximately corresponding to the extent of the stocks price fall below the strike price. Example: Let us assume 20000.shares of XYZ Limited held in the portfolio with a market value of Rs. 1000.per share (overall Rs. 2.crores). The scheme purchases put options on the stock of XYZ Limited (not exceeding its holding of 20000.shares) with a strike price of Rs. 990.for an assumed cost (called Option Premium) of. Rs.per share (Rs. 3.lakhs for 20000.shares). By purchasing the above Put Option, the scheme has effectively set a floor to the realisation from the stock at Rs. 975.per share. (Rs. 990.strike price less Rs. 15.Option Premium paid). In case the stock price of the company falls below Rs. 975.per share, the gain in the price of the Put Option when added to the actual market price of the stock would bring the sale realisation per share close to Rs. 975.per share. After purchasing the above Put Option, in case the price of the stock appreciates, remains around Rs. 1000.or declines slightly to remain above the strike price, the scheme may not avail of the option and the cost for having bought the option remains fixed at Rs. 15.per share. In effect, a floor (in this case effectively Rs. 975) is set to the stock by buying an Option at a cost that is known (in this case. Rs. 15.per share).                                                                         can be no assurance that ready liquidity would exist at all points in time, for the scheme to purchase or close out a specific options contract. A hedging strategy using Put Options is a perfect hedge on the expiration date of the put option. On other days, there may be (temporary) imperfect correlation between the share price and the put option. Strategy Number 3. Using Call option on Index to increase percentage investment in equities. This strategy will be used for the purpose of participating in the upside of the market. Example: Suppose, the Scheme has a corpus of Rs. 100.crore and the. Scheme on January 31, 2019.buys upto maximum 20% of the net assets into Index call option wherein strike price of underlying benchmark index is 10,000.and the premium on each call option for expiry after 3.years i.e. February 1, 2022.was at Rs. 2,000. Based on the above strategy the net assets of the Scheme will be as under: Option premium paid is to take an additional exposure of around Rs. 100.crores of equities. Therefore, the total exposure to equity assets due to the said strategy will be around Rs. 170.crores (i.e. Rs. 70.crores + Rs. 100.crores). Assuming the market index goes up the value of call option will increase. Thus, one can participate in the upside of the market as shown in the table below. Thus, the gain on the above strategy for the Scheme will be. Rs. 400.(Rs. 2,400.- Rs. 2,000) on each call option. RISKS. The strategy of taking a long position in index call option increases the exposure to the market. The long position is positively correlated with the market. However, there is no assurance that the stocks in the portfolio and the index behave in the same manner and thus this strategy may not provide gains perfectly aligned to the movement in the index. The risk/downside, if the market falls/remains flat is only limited to the option premium paid. The long position will have as much loss / gain as in the underlying index. For e.g. if the index appreciates by 10%, the index options value rises by 10%. However, this is true only for options held till maturity. While option markets are typically less liquid than the underlying cash market, hence there can be no assurance that ready liquidity would exist at all points in time, for the Scheme to purchase or close out a specific contract. Strategy Number 4. Using Put option on Index to minimize downside in equities. This strategy will be used for the purpose of hedging against downside in the market and capping the maximum loss in such a scenario. Example: Suppose, the Scheme has a corpus of Rs 100.crore and the. Scheme on January 31, 2019.buys 6% of the net assets into. At-the-money Index put option wherein strike price of underlying benchmark index having expiry February 1, 2022.index put option is Rs 10,000, bought at a premium of Rs. 600. Based on the above strategy the net assets of the Scheme will be as under: Option premium paid is to take downside exposure to. Rs 94.crore in underlying benchmark index. Therefore, the total exposure to long equities is Rs 94.crore and participation in downside of underlying benchmark index is Rs 94.crore through the option. Thus, the gain on the above strategy for the Scheme will be. Rs. 400.(Rs. 1,000.- Rs. 600) on each call option.                                                                        strategy of taking a long position in index put option hedges a portfolio of long only stocks/funds against potential markets falls. The long position in the put option is negatively correlated with the market. However, there is no assurance that the stocks in the portfolio and the index behave in the same manner and thus this strategy may not provide gains perfectly aligned to the movement in the index. The risk/downside, if the index remains above the strike price is only limited to the option premium paid. The premium paid is the maximum downside to the portfolio. There is positive return in the put strategy only if the index falls below the strike price. The long position will have as much loss / gain as the reverse of the underlying index. For e.g. if the index depreciates by 10%, the index options value rises by 10%. However, this is true only for options held till maturity. While option markets are typically less liquid than the underlying cash market, there can be no assurance that ready liquidity would exist at all points in time, for the. Scheme to purchase or close out a specific contract. In terms of Circular No. MFD.BC.191/07.279/1999-2000. and MPD.BC.187/07.279/1999-2000.dated November 1, 1999.and July 7, 1999.respectively issued by Reserve Bank of India, Mutual Funds are permitted participation in Interest. Rate Swaps and Forward Rate Agreements. These products. were introduced for deepening the countrys money market. The Scheme may trade in these instruments for the purpose of hedging and portfolio balancing or to undertake any other strategy as permitted under SEBI (MF) Regulations from time to time. SEBI has also permitted trading of interest rate derivatives through Stock Exchange. Strategies for Investment in Debt Derivatives as per derivative strategy of Scheme. RBI and SEBI over the years vide various circulars have permitted. Mutual Funds to participate in Interest Rate Swaps, Forward. Rate Agreements and Interest Rate Futures. These products were introduced for deepening the countrys debt and money. markets. The Scheme may trade in these instruments or any new instrument permitted by SEBI for the purpose of hedging and portfolio balancing or to undertake any other strategy as permitted under SEBI (MF) Regulations from time to time. SEBI has also permitted trading of interest rate derivatives through. Stock Exchange. Interest Rate Swaps (IRS). All swaps are financial contracts, which involve exchange. (swap) of a set of payments owned by one party for another set of payments owned by another party, usually through an intermediary (market maker). An IRS can be defined as a contract between two parties (Counter Parties) to exchange, on particular dates in the future, one series of cash flows, (fixed. interest) for another series of cashflows (variable or floating. interest) in the same currency and on the same principal for an agreed period of time. The exchange of cashflows need not occur on the same date. It may be noted that in such hedged positions (fixed v/s floating or vice versa), both legs of the transactions have interest rate volatility as underlying. Basic Structure of a Swap. Assume that the Scheme has a Rs. 20.crore floating rate investment linked to FBIL (Financial Benchmarks India Private. Ltd) : Overnight MIBOR (Mumbai Inter Bank Offered Rate). Hence, the Scheme is currently running an interest rate risk and stands to lose if the interest rate moves down. To hedge this interest rate risk, the Scheme can enter into a 6.month. MIBOR swap. Through this swap, the Scheme will receive a fixed predetermined rate (assume 7%) and pays the benchmark rate (MIBOR), which is fixed by the FBIL or any other agency such as Reuters,etc. This swap would effectively lock-in the rate of 7% for the next 6.months, eliminating the daily interest rate. The steps will be as follows -. Assuming the swap is for Rs. 20.crore June 1, 2019.to. December 1, 2019. The Scheme is a fixed rate receiver at 7% and the counterparty is a floating rate receiver at the overnight rate on a compounded basis (say MIBOR). On June 1, 2019.the Scheme and the counterparty will exchange only a contract of having entered this swap. This documentation would be as per International Swap Dealers. Association (ISDA). On a daily basis, the benchmark rate fixed by FBIL will be tracked by them. On December 1, 2019.they will calculate the following-. The Scheme is entitled to receive interest on Rs. 20. crore at 7% for 183.days i.e. Rs. 0.crore, (this amount is known at the time the swap was concluded) and will pay the compounded benchmark rate. The counterparty is entitled to receive daily compounded. MIBOR rate for 183.days & pay 7% fixed. On December 1, 2019, if the total interest on the daily overnight compounded benchmark rate is higher than. Rs. 0.crore, the Scheme will pay the difference to the counterparty. If the daily compounded benchmark rate is lower, then the counterparty will pay the Scheme the difference. Effectively the Scheme earns interest at the rate of 7% p.a. for six months without lending money for 6.months fixed, while the counterparty pays interest @ 7% p.a. for 6.months on Rs. 20.crore, without borrowing for 6.months. The above example illustrates the benefits and risks of using derivatives for hedging and optimizing the investment portfolio. Swaps have their own drawbacks like credit risk, settlement. risk. However, these risks are substantially reduced as the amount involved is interest streams and not principal. Forward Rate Agreement. A FRA is an agreement between two counter parties to pay or to receive the difference between an agreed fixed rate (the. FRA rate) and the interest rate prevailing on a stipulated future date, based on a notional amount, for an agreed period. In short, in a FRA, interest rate is fixed now for a future period. The special feature of FRAs is that the only payment is the difference between the FRA rate and the Reference rate and hence are single settlement contracts. As in the case of IRS, notional amounts are not exchanged. Assume that on December 1, 2019, the 30.day commercial paper (CP) rate is 7.75% and the Scheme has an investment in a CP of face value Rs. 25.crores, which is going to mature on December 30, 2019. If the fund managers view is that the interest rates are likely to remain stable or decline after. December 30, 2019, and if the fund manager, wants to re- deploy the maturity proceeds for 1.more month and does not want to take the risk of interest rates going down, he can then enter into a following forward rate agreement (FRA) say as on. December 1, 2019: He can receive 1.X 2.FRA at 7.75% (FRA rate in 1.month time for 1.months lending) on the notional amount of Rs. 25.crores, with a reference rate of 30.day CP benchmark. If the CP benchmark on the settlement date i.e. December 30, 2019.falls to 7.50%, then the Scheme receives the present value of 25.bps (7.75% - 7.50%) on the notional amount Rs. 25.crores for 1.month. The maturity proceeds are then reinvested at say. 7.50% (close to the benchmark). The scheme, however, would have locked in the rate prevailing on December 1, 2019. (7.75%) as it would have received 25.basis points on Rs. 25. cr as settlement amount from FRA. Thus the fund manager can use FRA to mitigate the reinvestment risk. In this example, if the rates move up by 25.basis points to 8% on the settlement date (December 30, 2019), the Scheme loses 25.basis points on Rs. 25.cr for 1.month, but since the reinvestment will then happen at 8%, effective returns for the. Scheme is unchanged at 7.75%, which is the prevailing rate on December 1, 2019. Interest Rate Futures (IRFs): An Interest Rate Futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a debt instrument at a specified future date at a price that is fixed today. The underlying security for Interest Rate Futures is either Government Bond, T-Bill or any other permitted benchmark security. IRFs contracts are cash settled. Holders of the fixed income securities are exposed to the risk of rising interest rates, which in turn results in the reduction in the value of their portfolio. So in order to protect against a fall in the value of their portfolio due to falling bond prices, they can take short position in IRF contracts. Example: Date: 15/12/2019. Spot price of GOI Security: Rs 105. May Futures price of IRF Contract: Rs 105. On 15/12/2019.ABC bought 2000.GOI securities from spot market at Rs 105. He anticipates that the interest rate will rise in near future. Therefore to hedge the exposure in underlying market he may sell December 2019.Interest Rate Futures contracts at Rs 105. On 30/12/2019.due to increase in interest rate: Spot price. Profit in the Futures market will be (104.: 105.12)2000.= Rs 1,680. Imperfect Hedging using IRF. IRF can be taken at portfolio level to reduce the interest rate risk of the portfolio or part of the portfolio (including one or more securities). However, in case the IRF used for hedging the interest rate risk has different underlying security(s) than the existing position being hedged, it would result in imperfect hedging ie basis risk. In order to reduce the basis risk for the portfolio hedging strategy, the correlation between the portfolio or part of the portfolio (excluding the hedged portions, if any) and the IRF would be atleast 0.at the time of initiation of. hedge. The correlation should be calculated for a period of last 90.days. Additionally, Imperfect hedging using IRFs would. Date: 15/06/2019. Total Assets of the Scheme: Rs. 100.cr. Modified Duration of the Scheme: 4. August 2019.Future Price of IRF contract of 6.GOI 2029: Modified Duration of 6.GOI 2029: 7. Correlation between IRF and Portfolio during last 90.days: On 15/06/2019, the fund manager anticipates that the interest rates will rise in near future. Therefore, to hedge the exposures of the portfolio he sells 19,00,000.IRF contracts of August 2019. 6.GOI 2029.at 103. Thus, the value of Futures contract is Rs. 19.cr, which is less than 20% of Scheme value. On 15/07/2019, due to interest rate increase by 5.basis points, the values of securities in the portfolio reduced to Rs. 99.cr and the price of IRF contract for August 2019.79. GOI 2029.reduced to Rs. 102.. This resulted in loss in the value of the securities of Rs. 0.cr (Rs. 100.cr - Rs. 99. cr) and profit in the futures position of Rs. 0.cr {(103.24-. Given that there was imperfect correlation between portfolio and the IRF (ie basis risk) as well as cap on the maximum portfolio hedging allowed as per extant regulation, the loss in the value of portfolio was not completely matched by the gain from the IRF contract. Nevertheless, the fund manager was able to protect the value of the portfolio, to an extent, using the IRF contract. The loss on proportionate basis (ie ~20% of portfolio) would have been only Rs. 0.cr as against gain of Rs. 0.cr of gain from IRF. Risk Factors of SWAP/ Forward Rate Agreement (FRA)/. Interest Rate Futures (IRF). Credit Risk: This is the risk of defaults by the counterparty. This is usually negligible, as there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative transaction. Market Risk: Market movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives. Liquidity Risk: The risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due to lack of liquidity in the market. Additional Risk viz. Basis Risk associated with imperfect hedging using Interest Rate Futures (IRF): The imperfect correlation between the prices of securities in the portfolio and the IRF contract used to hedge part of the portfolio leads to basis risk. Thus, the loss on the portfolio may not exactly match the gain from the hedge position entered using the IRF. PORTFOLIO                                                        Scheme is an open-ended Scheme. It is expected that there would be a number of subscriptions and redemptions on a daily basis. Consequently, it is difficult to estimate with any reasonable measure of accuracy, the likely turnover in the.

The total amount invested through Swing STP over its tenure in the Transferee. Scheme, may be higher or lower than the Total Target Market Value of the investment (i.e. the first installment amount X total number of installments specified by the Unitholder).

I.                                                          A. RISK FACTORS. Standard Risk Factors: Investment in Mutual Fund Units involves investment risks such as trading volumes, settlement risk, liquidity risk, default risk including the possible loss of principal. As the price / value / interest rates of the securities in which the Scheme invests fluctuates, the value of your investment in the Scheme may go up or down depending on the various factors and forces affecting the capital markets and money markets. Past performance of the Sponsors and their affiliates/. AMC/ Mutual Fund does not guarantee future performance of the Scheme of the Mutual Fund. The name of the Scheme does not in any manner indicate either the quality of the Scheme or its future prospects and. The Sponsors are not responsible or liable for any loss resulting from the operation of the Scheme beyond the initial contribution of Rs. 1.lakh each made by them towards setting up the Fund. The present Scheme is not guaranteed or assured return. Scheme Specific Risk Factors. Some of the specific risk factors related to the Scheme include, but are not limited to the following: (i) Risk factors associated with investing in equities and equity related instruments. Equity shares and equity related instruments are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis. Investments in equity shares and equity related instruments involve a degree of risk and investors should not invest in the. Scheme unless they can afford to take the risks. Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and carry a larger amount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the exchanges. Investment in such securities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk. While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell these investments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. (ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed. Income Securities. The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money Market instruments, will be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. The NAV of the Scheme is expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be adversely affected by an increase in the level of interest rates. Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market, which may restrict the selling. ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term rating of the issuers. Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e. the risk of an issuers inability to meet interest or principal payments on its. obligations) or any other issues, which may have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial conditions of an issuer, changes in economic and political conditions in general, or changes in economic or and political conditions specific to an issuer, all of which are factors that may have an adverse impact on an issuers credit quality and security values. The Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit risk through in-house credit. analysis. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. The. Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit risk through in-house credit analysis. Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price-risk like any other fixed income security. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest rates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a function of the existing coupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest rates. The new level of interest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises new money and/or the price levels at which the market is already dealing in existing securities. The price-risk is not unique to Government Securities. It exists for all fixed income securities. However, Government Securities are unique in the sense that their credit risk generally remains. zero. Therefore, their prices are influenced only by movement in interest rates in the financial system. Different types of fixed income securities in which the. Scheme would invest as given in the Scheme Information. Document carry different levels and types of risk. Accordingly, the Scheme risk may increase or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e.g. corporate bonds carry higher level of risk than Government securities. Further even among corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are comparatively less risky than AA rated bonds. The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated / unrated securities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the absolute level of risk of the portfolio. As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the security, these securities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to issuer default risk. Therefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The AMC may choose to invest in zero coupon securities that offer attractive. yields. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. Zero coupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that do not entitle the holder to any periodic payment of interest prior to maturity or a specified date when the securities begin paying current interest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face. values. The discount depends on the time remaining until. maturity or the date when securities begin paying current. interest. It also varies depending on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the perceived credit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are generally more volatile than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically. Schemes performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the investments held in the debt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal circumstances. Prepayment Risk: Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its securities before their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of such prepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in securities offering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme. Reinvestment Risk: This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received from the securities in the Scheme are reinvested. The additional income from reinvestment is the interest on interest component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows can be reinvested may be lower than that originally assumed. Settlement risk: Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. Delays or other problems in settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods when the assets of the. Scheme are uninvested and no return is earned thereon. The inability of the Scheme to make intended securities purchases, due to settlement problems, could cause the. Scheme to miss certain investment opportunities. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held in the Schemes portfolio, due to the absence of a well developed and liquid secondary market for debt securities, may result at times in potential losses to the Scheme in the event of a subsequent decline in the value of securities held in the Schemes portfolio. The Scheme at times may receive large number of redemption requests, leading to an asset-liability mismatch and therefore, requiring the investment manager to make distress sale of the securities leading to realignment of the portfolio and consequently resulting in investment in lower yield instruments. (iii) Risk factors associated with investment in Tri-Party. Repo. The mutual fund is a member of securities segment and. Triparty Repo trade settlement of the Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL). All transactions of the mutual fund in government securities and in Tri-party Repo trades are settled centrally through the infrastructure and settlement systems provided by CCIL. thus reducing the settlement and counterparty risks considerably for transactions in the said segments. The members are required to contribute an amount as communicated by CCIL from time to time to the default fund maintained by CCIL as a part of the default waterfall (a loss mitigating measure of CCIL in case of default by any member in settling transactions routed through CCIL). As per the waterfall mechanism, after the defaulters margins and the defaulters contribution to the default fund have been appropriated, CCILs contribution is used to meet the losses. Post utilization of CCILs contribution if there is a residual loss, it is appropriated from the default fund contributions of the non-defaulting members. Thus the scheme is subject to risk of the initial margin and default fund contribution being invoked in the event of failure of any settlement obligations. In addition, the fund contribution is allowed to be used to meet the residual loss in case of default by the other clearing member (the defaulting member). CCIL shall maintain two separate Default Funds in respect of its Securities Segment, one with a view to meet losses arising out of any default by its members from outright and repo trades and the other for meeting losses arising out of any default by its members from Triparty Repo. trades. The mutual fund is exposed to the extent of its contribution to the default fund of CCIL, in the event that the contribution of the mutual fund is called upon to absorb settlement/default losses of another member by. CCIL, as a result the scheme may lose an amount equivalent to its contribution to the default fund. (iv) Risk factors associated with investing in Non- Convertible. Preference Shares. Credit Risk - Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will be unable to meet its obligation of payment of dividend and/ or redemption of principal amount on the due date. Further, for non-cumulative preference shares, issuer also has an option to not pay dividends on preference shares in case of inadequate profits in any year. Liquidity Risk - The preference shares generally have limited secondary market liquidity and thus we may be forced to hold the instrument till maturity. Unsecured in nature - Preference shares are unsecured in nature and rank lower than secured and unsecured debt in hierarchy of payments in case of liquidation. Thus there is significant risk of capital erosion in case the company goes into liquidation. (v) Related to HDFC Arbitrage Fund. A. The primary objective of the Fund Manager is to identify investment opportunities and to exploit price discrepancies in various markets. Identification and exploitation of the strategies to be pursued by the Fund Manager involve. uncertainty. No assurance can be given that Fund Manager will be able to locate investment opportunities or to correctly exploit price discrepancies in the capital markets. Reduction in mis-pricing opportunities between the cash market and Future and Options market may lead to lower level of activity affecting the returns. As the Scheme proposes to execute arbitrage transactions in various markets simultaneously, this may result in high portfolio turnover and, consequently, high transaction cost. There may be instances, where the price spread between cash and derivative market is insufficient to meet the cost of carry. In such situations, the fund manager due to lack of opportunities in the derivative market may not be able to outperform liquid / money market funds. Though the constituent stocks of most indices are typically liquid, liquidity differs across stock. Due to heterogeneity in liquidity in the capital market segment, trades on this segment do not get implemented instantly. This often makes arbitrage expensive, risky and difficult to structure. An equity oriented fund has been defined under the. Income Tax Act as a scheme of a mutual fund where the investible funds are invested in equity shares of domestic companies to the extent of more than 65.per cent of the total assets of such fund. The percentage of equity shareholding of the fund shall be computed with reference to the annual average of the monthly averages of the opening and closing figures. As per the asset allocation, under normal circumstances, the Scheme shall invest minimum 65% of its total assets in Equity and Equity Related instruments. However, under defensive circumstances, where the debt / money market instruments offer better returns than the arbitrage opportunities available in cash and derivatives segments of equity markets, then the investment manager may choose to have a lower equity exposure for a prolonged. period. In such a case, the fund may be regarded as a debt oriented fund as per extant Income Tax laws and consequently may not enjoy the favourable tax provisions available for equity oriented mutual funds in that particular financial year. In such situation, a Unitholder who has redeemed the units during that financial year may end up paying capital gain tax as applicable to a debt fund and consequently would also not be able to derive any benefit of STT paid at the time of redemption. Investors are requested to refer to the section Taxation on page 74. In view of the forgoing and individual nature of tax consequences, each Unit holder is advised to consult his / her own professional tax advisor. (vi) General Risk factors. Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances leading to delays in receipt of proceeds from sale of securities. The NAV of the Units of the Scheme can go up or down because of various factors that affect the capital markets in general. As the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme could, at times, be restricted by trading volumes and settlement periods, the time taken by the Mutual Fund for redemption of Units may be significant in the event of an inordinately large number of redemption requests or restructuring of the Scheme. In view of the above, the. Trustee has the right, in its sole discretion, to limit redemptions (including suspending redemptions) under certain circumstances, as described on Page 45.under Right to Restrict Redemption and / or Suspend. Redemption of the units.. At times, due to the forces and factors affecting the capital market, the Scheme may not be able to invest in securities falling within its investment objective resulting in holding the monies collected by it in cash or cash equivalent or invest the same in other permissible securities / investments amounting to substantial reduction in the earning capability of the Scheme. The Scheme may retain certain investments in cash or cash equivalents for its day-to-day liquidity requirements. Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and carry a larger amount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the exchanges or offer other exit options to the investor, including a put option. The AMC may choose to invest in unlisted securities that offer attractive returns. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. Investment strategy to be adopted by the Scheme may carry the risk of significant variance between the portfolio allocation of the Scheme and the Benchmark particularly over a short to medium term period. Performance of the Scheme may be affected by political, social, and economic developments, which may include changes in government policies, diplomatic conditions, and taxation policies. (vii) Risk factors associated with investing in Foreign. Securities. Currency Risk: Moving from Indian Rupee (INR) to any other currency entails currency risk. To the extent that the assets of the. Scheme will be invested in securities denominated in foreign currencies, the Indian Rupee equivalent of the net assets, distributions and income may be adversely affected by changes in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian Rupee. Interest Rate Risk: The pace and movement of interest rate cycles of various countries, though loosely co-related, can differ significantly. Hence by investing in securities of countries other than. India, the Scheme stand exposed to their interest rate. Investment in Foreign Debt Securities are subject to the risk of an issuers inability to meet interest and principal payments on its obligations and market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer. This is substantially reduced since the SEBI (MF) Regulations stipulate investments only in debt instruments with rating not below investment grade by accredited/registered credit rating agency. Taxation Risk: In addition to the disclosure related to taxation mentioned under section Special Consideration on Page 10, Investment in Foreign Securities poses additional challenges based on the tax laws of each respective country or. jurisdiction. The scheme may be subject to a higher level of taxes than originally anticipated and or dual taxation. The Scheme may be subject to withholding or other taxes on income and/or gains arising from its investment. portfolio. Further, such investments are exposed to risks associated with the changing / evolving tax / regulatory regimes of all the countries where the Scheme invests. All these may entail a higher outgo to the Scheme by way of taxes, transaction costs, fees etc. thus adversely impacting its NAV. resulting in lower returns to an Investor. Legal and Regulatory Risk: Legal and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Scheme which may adversely affect it. If any of the laws and regulations currently in effect should change or any new laws or regulations should be enacted, the legal requirements to which the Scheme and the investors may be subject could differ materially from current requirements and may materially and adversely affect the Scheme and the investors. Legislation/ Regulatory guidelines could also be imposed retrospectively. Country Risk: The Country risk arises from the inability of a country, to meet its financial obligations. It is the risk encompassing economic, social and political conditions in a foreign country, which might adversely affect foreign investors financial interests. In addition, country risks would include events such as introduction of extraordinary exchange controls, economic deterioration, bi-lateral conflict leading to immobilisation of the overseas financial assets and the prevalent tax laws of the respective jurisdiction for execution of trades or otherwise. To manage risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate exposure, the Mutual Fund may use derivatives for efficient portfolio management including hedging and in accordance with conditions as may be stipulated by. SEBI/ RBI from time to time. (viii) Risk factors associated with investing in. Derivatives. The AMC, on behalf of the Scheme may use various derivative products, from time to time, in an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unit holders. interest. Derivative products are specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analysis different from those associated with stocks and bonds. The use of derivative requires an understanding not only of the underlying instrument but of the derivative itself. Other risks include, the risk of mispricing or improper valuation and the inability of derivatives to correlate perfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices. Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well as disproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the ability of the fund manager to identify such. opportunities. Identification and execution of the strategies to be pursued by the fund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund manager may not always be profitable. No assurance can be given that the fund manager will be able to identify or execute such strategies. The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the risks associated with. investing directly in securities and other traditional. The credit risk in derivative transaction is the risk that the counter party will default on its obligations and is generally low, as there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative transaction. Market Risk: Market movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives. Illiquidity risk: This is the risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due to lack of liquidity in the market. Additional Risk viz. Basis Risk associated with imperfect hedging using Interest Rate Futures (IRF): The imperfect correlation between the prices of securities in the portfolio and the IRF contract used to hedge part of the portfolio leads to basis risk. Thus, the loss on the portfolio may not exactly match the gain from the hedge position entered using the IRF. (vii) Risk factors associated with Securities Lending. As with other modes of extensions of credit, there are risks inherent to securities lending, including the risk of failure of the other party, in this case the approved intermediary, to comply with the terms of the agreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme and the approved. intermediary. Such failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the collateral put up by the borrower of the securities, the inability of the approved intermediary to return the securities deposited by the lender and the possible loss of any corporate benefits accruing to the lender from the securities deposited with the approved intermediary. (ix) Risk factors associated with investing in Securitised. Debt. The Risks involved in Securitised Papers described below are the principal ones and does not represent that the statement of risks set out hereunder is exhaustive. Limited Liquidity & Price Risk. There is no assurance that a deep secondary market will develop for the Certificates. This could limit the ability of the investor to resell them. Limited Recourse, Delinquency and Credit Risk. The Credit Enhancement stipulated represents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These Certificates represent an undivided beneficial interest in the underlying receivables and do not represent an obligation of either the Issuer or the Seller or the originator, or the parent or any affiliate of the Seller, Issuer and Originator. No financial recourse is available to the Certificate Holders against the Investors. Representative. Delinquencies and credit losses may cause depletion of the amount available under the Credit. Enhancement and thereby the Investor Payouts to the. Certificate Holders may get affected if the amount available in the Credit Enhancement facility is not enough to cover. the shortfall. On persistent default of a Obligor to repay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess and sell the. Asset. However many factors may affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such Asset or the length of time required to realise the sale proceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at which such Asset may be sold may be lower than the amount due from that Obligor. Risks due to possible prepayments and Charge. Offs. In the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in tenor and yield. Also, any Charge Offs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass. Through Certificates (PTCs). Bankruptcy of the Swap Bank. If the Swap Bank, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings then an Investor could experience losses or delays in the payments due under the Interest Rate Swap. Risk of Co-mingling. With respect to the Certificates, the Servicer will deposit all payments received from the Obligors into the Collection. Account. However, there could be a time gap between collection by a Servicer and depositing the same into the. Collection account especially considering that some of the collections may be in the form of cash. In this interim period, collections from the Loan Agreements may not be segregated from other funds of originator. If originator in its capacity as Servicer fails to remit such funds due to. Investors, the Investors may be exposed to a potential loss. (x)    Risk factors associated with processing of transaction through Stock Exchange Mechanism. The trading mechanism introduced by the stock exchange(s) is configured to accept and process transactions for mutual fund units in both Physical and Demat Form. The allotment and/or redemption of Units through NSE and/or BSE or any other recognised stock exchange(s), on any Business Day will depend upon the modalities of processing viz. collection of application form, order processing/settlement, etc. upon which the Fund has no control. Moreover, transactions conducted through the stock exchange mechanism shall be governed by the operating guidelines and directives issued by respective recognized stock exchange(s). (xi) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs: Price Risk: Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis owing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in general market conditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and Infrastructure sectors, level of interest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures. Interest Rate Risk: Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate. risk. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase. Credit Risk: Credit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest payment or even on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/. Instruments of REITs and InvITs are likely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not necessarily be pre scheduled. Liquidity Risk: This refers to the ease with which securities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There is no assurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there would be time when trading in the units could be infrequent. The subsequent valuation of illiquid units may reflect a discount from the market price of comparable securities/instruments for which a liquid market exists. As these products are new to the market they are likely to be exposed to liquidity risk. Reinvestment Risk: Investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there could be repatriation of funds by the Trusts in form of buyback of units or dividend pay-outs, etc. Consequently, the proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns. Legal and Regulatory Risk. The regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs comprises a relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and enforcement by regulators and courts involves uncertainties. Presently, it is difficult to forecast as to how any new laws, regulations or standards or future amendments will affect the issuers of REITs/InvITs and the sector as a whole. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that the regulatory system will not change in a way that will impair the ability of the Issuers to comply with the regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively or make distributions. B. REQUIREMENT OF MINIMUM INVESTORS IN. THE SCHEME. The Scheme shall have a minimum of 20.investors and no single investor shall account for more than 25% of the corpus of the Scheme (at portfolio level). The two conditions mentioned above shall be complied within each subsequent calendar quarter, on an average basis, as specified by SEBI. In case the Scheme does not have a minimum of 20.investors in the stipulated period, the provisions of Regulation 39(2)(c) of the. SEBI (MF) Regulations would become applicable automatically without any reference from SEBI and accordingly the Scheme shall be wound up and the units would be redeemed at applicable NAV. If there is a breach of the 25% limit by any investor over the quarter, a rebalancing period of one month would be allowed and thereafter the investor who is in breach of the rule shall be given 15.days notice to redeem his exposure over the 25% limit. Failure on the part of the said investor to redeem his exposure over the 25% limit within the aforesaid 15.days would lead to automatic redemption by the Mutual. Fund on the applicable Net Asset Value on the 15th day of the notice period. The Fund shall adhere to the requirements prescribed by SEBI from time to time in this regard. C. SPECIAL                                                 information set out in the Scheme Information Document.

The Product labeling mandated by SEBI is to provide investors an easy understanding of the risk involved in the kind of product / scheme they are investing to meet their financial goals. The Riskometer categorizes the schemes of Fund under different levels of risk based on the scheme investment objective, asset allocation pattern, investment strategy and typical investment time horizon of investors. Therefore, the scheme falling under the same level of risk in the Riskometer may not be similar in nature. Investors are advised before investing to evaluate a scheme not only on the basis of the Product labeling (including the. Riskometer) but also on other quantitative and qualitative factors such as performance, portfolio, fund managers, asset manager, etc. and shall also consult their financial advisers, if they are unsure about the suitability of the scheme before investing.

The instruments available in Indian Debt Market are classified into two categories, namely Government and Non - Government. debt. The instruments available in these categories include: A] Government Debt -. Central Government Debt. Treasury Bills. Dated Government Securities :    Coupon Bearing Bonds :    Floating Rate Bonds :    Zero Coupon Bonds. State Government Debt :    State Government Loans :    Coupon Bearing Bonds. B] Non-Government Debt. Instruments issued by Government Agencies and other. Statutory Bodies. Government Guaranteed Bonds. PSU Bonds. Instruments issued by Public Sector Undertakings. Commercial Paper. PSU Bonds. Fixed Coupon Bonds. Floating Rate Bonds. Zero Coupon Bonds. Instruments issued by Banks and Development Financial. Institutions. Certificates of Deposit. Promissory Notes. Bonds. Fixed Coupon Bonds. Floating Rate Bonds. Zero Coupon Bonds. Instruments issued by Corporate Bodies. Commercial Paper. Non-Convertible Debentures. Fixed Coupon Debentures. Floating Rate Debentures. Zero Coupon Debentures. Pass Through Securities. Activity in the Primary and Secondary Market is dominated by. Central Government Securities including Treasury Bills. These instruments comprise close to 60% of all outstanding debt and more than 75% of the daily trading volume on the Wholesale. Debt Market Segment of the National Stock Exchange of India. In the money market, activity levels of the Government and. Non- Government Debt vary from time to time. Instruments that comprise a major portion of money market activity include, Overnight Call. Repo/Reverse Repo Agreements. Tri-party Repos (TREPs). Treasury Bills. Government Securities with a residual maturity of < 1.year. Commercial Paper. Certificates of Deposit. Bills Rediscounting Scheme. Though not strictly classified as Money Market Instruments, PSU/ DFI / Corporate paper with a residual maturity of < 1.year, are actively traded and offer a viable investment option. The following table gives approximate yields prevailing during the month ended March 2019.on some of the instruments. These yields are indicative and do not indicate yields that may be obtained in future as interest rates keep changing consequent to changes in macro economic conditions and RBI policy. These yields are indicative and do not indicate yields that may be obtained in future as interest rates keep changing consequent to changes in macro economic conditions and RBI policy. The price and yield on various debt instruments fluctuate from time to time depending upon the macro economic situation, inflation rate, overall liquidity position, foreign exchange scenario etc. Also, the price and yield vary according to maturity profile, credit risk etc. Generally, for instruments issued by a non-Government entity (corporate / PSU bonds), the yield is higher than the yield on. Government Security with corresponding maturity. The difference, known as credit spread, depends on the credit rating of the entity. Overseas Debt Market. The nature and number of debt instruments available in international debt markets is very wide. In terms of diverse instruments as well as liquidity, overseas debt markets offer great depth and are extremely well developed. Investment in international debt greatly expands the universe of top quality debt, which is no longer restricted to the limited papers available in the domestic debt market. The higher rated overseas sovereign, quasi-government and corporate debt offer lower default risk in addition to offering a high degree of liquidity since these are traded across major international. markets. Investments in rated international debt offer multiple benefits of risk reduction, a much wider universe of top quality debt and also potential gains from currency movements. Investments in international markets are most often in U.S. dollars, though the Euro, Pound Sterling and the Yen are also major currencies. Though this market is geographically well spread across global financial centres, the markets in the U.S., European Union and London offer the most liquidity and depth of instruments. Besides factors specific to the country / issuer, international bond prices are influenced to a large extent by a number of other factors. chief among these are the international economic outlook, changes in interest rates in major economies, trading volumes in overseas markets, cross currency movements among major currencies, rating changes of countries / corporations and major political changes globally. The approximate yields to maturity in the US Bond Market are as follows: Corporate Bond yields rate (%) (As at March 29, 2019) (Source - Bloomberg). Composite curve include AA-, AA, AA+ as US AAA curve has been discontinued. D. WHERE WILL THE SCHEME INVEST?.

The maturity profile of debt instruments will be selected in accordance with the AMCs view regarding current market conditions, interest rate outlook and the stability of ratings. Investments in Debt and Money Market Instruments will be as per the limits specified in the asset allocation table(s) of the Scheme, subject to permissible limits laid under SEBI. (MF) Regulations.

The appointment of such intermediaries shall be in accordance with the applicable requirements of SEBI and within the permissible ceilings of expenses as stated under Regulation 52.of SEBI (MF) Regulations. Investment in Securitised Debt. securitisation transaction involves sale of receivables by the originator (a bank, non-banking finance company, housing finance company, or a manufacturing/service company) to a. Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), typically set up in the form of trust. Investors are issued rated Pass Through Certificates. (PTCs), the proceeds of which are paid as consideration to the. originator. In this manner, the originator, by selling his loan receivables to an SPV, receives consideration from investors much before the maturity of the underlying loans. Investors are paid from the collections of the underlying loans from. borrowers. Typically, the transaction is provided with a limited amount of credit enhancement (as stipulated by the rating. agency for a target rating), which provides protection to investors against defaults by the underlying borrowers. Generally available asset classes for securitisation in India are: Commercial vehicles. Auto and two wheeler pools. Mortgage pools (residential housing loans). Personal loan, credit card and other retail loans. Corporate loans/receivables. Investment / Risk Mitigation Strategy. 1.   Risk profile of securitised debt vis--vis risk appetite of the Scheme(s). The risk profile of securitised debt is generally at par with the risk profile of other debt securities at the same level of credit. rating. Securitised debt offers additional income (spread) over debt security of similar rating and maturity, which enables the scheme to optimize its income without taking any additional credit risk. Securitised debt is generally less liquid, however, investment in securitised debt is made to maintain a diversified portfolio of debt securities that optimizes return without increasing the overall risk profile of the Scheme. 2.   Policy relating to originators based on nature of originator, track record, NPAs, losses in earlier securitised debt, etc. The originator is an entity (like banks, non-banking finance companies, corporates etc), which has initially provided the loan & is also generally responsible for servicing the loans. The schemes will invest in securitised debt of originators with at least investment grade credit rating and established track. record. A detailed evaluation of originator is done before the investment is made in securitised debt of any originator on various parameters given below: Track record. The investment in securitised debt is done based on origination and underwriting process and capabilities of the originator, overview of corporate structure, group to which they belong, experience of the company in the business & how long they have been in the business, financial condition of the company, credit rating, past performance of similar pools by the originator, Willingness to pay through credit enhancement facilities. Credit enhancement is provided by the originator, as indicated by rating agencies, so as to adequately cover the defaults and acts as a risk mitigation measure. The size of the credit enhancement as indicated by rating agency depends on the originators track record, past delinquencies, pattern of the portfolio & characteristics of the pool vis-a-vis of the portfolio, nature of the asset class. Ability to pay. The quality of the origination impacts the performance of the underlying asset & thus originators with strong systems and processes in place can eliminate poor quality assets. A robust risk management system of the originator and availability of. MIS reports on timely basis, results in creation of strong asset. Business Risk Assessment. The business risk assessment of originator / underlying borrower also includes detailed credit assessment wherein following factors are also considered: 1.    Outlook for the economy (domestic and global) 2.    Outlook for the industry 3.    Company specific factors. In addition, a detailed review and assessment of rating rationale is done along with interactions with the company as well as the rating agency. All investment in securitised debt is done after taking into account, the Critical Evaluation Parameters (for pool loan and single loan securitisation transactions) regarding the originator / underlying issuer as mentioned below: Default track record/ frequent alteration of redemption conditions / covenants. High leverage ratios of the ultimate borrower (for single- sell downs) - both on a standalone basis as well on a consolidated level/ group level. Higher proportion of reschedulement of underlying assets of the pool or loan, as the case may be. Higher proportion of overdue assets of the pool or the underlying loan, as the case may be. Poor reputation in market. Insufficient track record of servicing of the pool or the loan, as the case may be. 3.   Risk mitigation strategies for investments with each kind of originator. Investments are based on assessment of following parameters, so as to mitigate risk associated with such investment: a.   Credit quality, size and reach of the originator. b.   Nature of receivables/asset category i.e. cars, construction equipment, commercial vehicles, personal loans etc. c.   Collection process, infrastructure and follow-up mechanism. d.   Quality of MIS. e.   Credit cum liquidity enhancement. f.   Credit appraisal norms of originator. g.   Asset Quality - portfolio delinquency levels. h.   Past performance of rated pools. i.   Pool Characteristics - seasoning, Loan-to-value ratios, geographic diversity etc. 4.   The level of diversification with respect to the underlying assets, and risk mitigation measures for less diversified investments. Diversification of underlying assets is achieved through a) prudent mix of asset categories - i.e. cars (new, used), commercial vehicles, construction equipment, unsecured loans to individuals or small & medium enterprises b) total number of contracts in a pool c) average ticket size of loans and d) geographical distribution. Risk mitigation measures for less diversified investments in pools is accomplished through the size of credit enhancement, seasoning or loan to value ratios. Construction. Equipment. (including cash, guarantees, excess interest spread, subordinate tranche). exposure range %. NA - Not Applicable. Information in the table above is based on current scenario and is subject to change depending upon the change in related. Notes: A. In case of securitised debt with underlying being single loan, the investment limit applicable to the underlying borrower is considered. B.   Other investment will be decided on a case to case basis. In case of asset backed pools (ABS), evaluation of the pool assets is done considering the following factors: (Refer the table above which illustrates the averages of parameters considered while selecting the pool). Size of the loan. Average original maturity of the pool. Loan to Value Ratio. Average seasoning of the pool. Default rate distribution. Geographical Distribution. Credit enhancement facility. Liquid facility. Structure of the pool. 5.   Minimum retention period of the debt by originator prior to securitisation. The illustrative average seasoning of the debt by originator prior to securitisation is given above in table (Refer Point 4). Minimum retention period of the debt by originator prior to securitisation in the case of asset pools is in the form of seasoning of loans to various asset classes (cars, commercial vehicles, etc.) and generally varies from one month to six months depending on the nature of asset. While minimum retention percentage by originator is not prescribed, any amount retained by the originator through subordination is viewed positively at the time of making investment and generally varies from 5% to 10%. 7.    The mechanism to tackle conflict of interest when the mutual fund invests in securitised debt of an originator and the originator in turn makes investments in that particular scheme of the fund. All proposals for investment in securitised debt are evaluated by the credit analyst based on several parameters such as nature of underlying asset category, pool characteristics, asset quality, credit rating of the securitisation transaction, and credit cum liquidity enhancement available. Investment in securitised debt in any scheme is made by the respective fund manager in line with the investment objective of that scheme. 8.    The resources and mechanism of individual risk assessment with the AMC for monitoring investment in securitised debt (in general). Investment in securitised debt is monitored regularly with regards to its performance on various parameters such as collection efficiency, delinquencies, prepayments and utilization of credit enhancement. Information on these parameters is available through monthly reports from Pool Trustees and through information disseminated by the rating agencies. Monthly performance report is released by the credit analyst to the fund management team and the fund management team periodically reviews the same.    Trading in Derivatives. The Scheme may invest in derivatives based on the opportunities available subject to the guidelines provided by SEBI from time to time and in line with the overall investment objective of the. Scheme. The Scheme may invest in derivative instruments like. Futures, Options, Interest Rate Swaps, Forward Rate Agreements, and such other derivative instruments as may be permitted by. SEBI from time to time. Derivative investments may be undertaken to hedge the portfolio, re-balance the same or to undertake any other strategy as permitted under SEBI (MF) Regulations from time to time. Hedging could be perfect or imperfect. In case the Scheme has investment in foreign securities, then it may hedge the exchange rate risk on all receivables on these instruments through various derivative products such as forwards, currency futures/ options, etc. Derivatives can be traded over the exchange or can be structured between two counter-parties. Those transacted over the exchange are called Exchange Traded derivatives whereas the other category is referred to as OTC (Over the Counter) derivatives. Some of the differences of these two derivative categories are as under: Exchange traded derivatives: These are quoted on the exchanges like any other traded asset class. The most common amongst these are the Index Futures, Index Options, Stock Futures and. Options on individual equities / securities. The basic form of the futures contract is similar to that of the forward contract, a futures contract obligates its owner to purchase a specified asset at a specified exercise price on the contract maturity date. Futures are cash-settled and are traded only in organised exchanges. Exchange traded derivatives are standardised in terms of amount and delivery date. Standardisation and transparency generally ensures a liquid market together with narrower spreads. On the other hand, for delivery dates far in the future, there may be insufficient liquidity in the futures market whereas an OTC price may be available. OTC derivatives: OTC derivatives require the two parties engaging in a derivatives transaction to come together through process of negotiation. It is a derivative that is customised in terms of structure, amount, tenor, underlying assets, collateral. etc. Some of the common examples are interest rate and currency swaps, Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) etc. Exposure to Derivatives.

Exposure to a single counterparty in such transactions should not exceed 10% of the net assets of the scheme. 7.   Exposure due to derivative positions taken for hedging purposes in excess of the underlying position against which the hedging position has been taken, shall be treated under the limits mentioned in point 1. 8.   Definition of Exposure in case of Derivative Positions. Each position taken in derivatives shall have an associated exposure as defined under. Exposure is the maximum possible loss that may occur on a. position. However, certain derivative positions may theoretically have unlimited possible loss. Exposure in derivative positions shall be computed as follows: Exposure limits on Interest Rate Futures (IRF). The exposure limits for trading in Interest Rate Futures. (IRFs) by Mutual Funds specified by SEBI vide its Circular. No. SEBI/HO/IMD/DF2/CIR/P/2017/109.dated September 27, 2017.are as follows: i.    To reduce interest rate risk in a debt portfolio, mutual funds may hedge the portfolio or part of the portfolio (including one or more securities) on weighted average modified duration basis by using Interest Rate Futures. (IRFs). The maximum extent of short position that may be taken in IRFs to hedge interest rate risk of the portfolio or part of the portfolio, is as per the formula given below: (Portfolio Modified Duration. Market Value of the Portfolio) (Futures Modified Duration Futures Price/PAR). ii.   In case the IRF used for hedging the interest rate risk has different underlying security(s) than the existing position being hedged, it would result in imperfect. iii. Imperfect hedging using IRFs may be considered to be exempted from the gross exposure, upto maximum of 20% of the net assets of the scheme, subject to the following: a.    Exposure to IRFs is created only for hedging the interest rate risk based on the weighted average modified duration of the bond portfolio or part of the. b.    Mutual Funds are permitted to resort to imperfect hedging, without it being considered under the gross exposure limits, if and only if, the correlation between the portfolio or part of the portfolio (excluding the hedged portions, if any) and the IRF is atleast 0.at the time of initiation of hedge. In case of any subsequent deviation from the correlation criteria, the same may be rebalanced within 5.working days and if not rebalanced within the timeline, the derivative positions created for hedging shall be considered under the gross exposure computed in terms of SEBI circular dated August 18, 2010. The correlation should be calculated for a period of last 90.days. Explanation: If the fund manager intends to do imperfect hedging upto 15% of the portfolio using IRFs on weighted average modified duration basis, either of the following conditions need to be complied with: i.   The correlation for past 90.days between the portfolio and the IRF is at least 0.or. ii. The correlation for past 90.days between the part of the portfolio (excluding the hedged portions, if any). i.e. at least 15% of the net asset of the scheme (including one or more securities) and the IRF is at least 0. c. At no point of time, the net modified duration of part of the portfolio being hedged should be negative. d. The portion of imperfect hedging in excess of 20% of the net assets of the scheme should be considered as creating exposure and shall be included in the computation of gross exposure in terms of SEBI circular. dated August 18, 2010. E. WHAT ARE THE INVESTMENT STRATEGIES?                                     Scheme will seek to generate income through arbitrage opportunities such as Index/Stock Spot vs Index/Stock Futures or Index Futures vs Stock Futures or Future of same stock with different expiry months or ADR/GDR vs underlying shares etc. The Scheme may use corporate action or event driven strategy where there is a potential opportunity for arbitrage in cash or derivate market such as dividend arbitrage or buy-back arbitrage or merger etc. The Scheme would carry out simple strategies, which would be to take offsetting positions on various markets simultaneously across various asset classes. The overall risk the Scheme would carry would be that of being market neutral. The Scheme would not attempt to leverage or have short positions. Investment in Debt securities (including securitised debt) and money market instruments will be as per the limits in the asset allocation table of the Scheme, subject to permissible limits laid under SEBI (MF) Regulations. Investment in debt securities. Subject to the Regulations and the applicable guidelines, the. Scheme may, engage in Stock Lending activities. The Scheme may also invest in the hybrid securities viz. units of REITs and InvITs for diversification and subject to necessary stipulations by SEBI from time to time. The Scheme may also invest in the schemes of Mutual Funds. Though every endeavour will be made to achieve the objective of the Scheme, the AMC/ Sponsors/Trustee do not guarantee that the investment objective of the Scheme will be achieved. No guaranteed returns are being offered under the Scheme. Risk Control. Investments made from the net assets of the Scheme would be in accordance with the investment objective of the Scheme and the provisions of the SEBI (MF) Regulations. The AMC will strive to achieve the investment objective by way of a judicious portfolio mix comprising of Debt and Money Market Instruments and equity/ equity related instruments. Risk Mitigation measures for investments in equity / equity related and debt instruments. In the event of inadequate arbitrage opportunities or inadequate liquidity in those securities, the Scheme provides for allocating upto 100% of assets in debt and money/ market securities for generating regular income. Investments in debt / money market securities would be undertaken after assessing the associated credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Scheme seeks to manage the duration of debt assets on a proactive basis to manage interest rate risks and to optimise returns. credit evaluation of each debt exposure would be. undertaken. This would also consider the credit ratings given to the instrument by recognised rating agencies. Investments in debt / money market securities would normally be undertaken in instruments that have been assigned high investment grade ratings by any of the recognised rating agencies. Unrated investments, if any, would require specific approval from a committee constituted for the purpose. Credit Evaluation Policy. The credit evaluation policy of the AMC entails evaluation of credit fundamentals of each investment opportunity. Some of the factors that are evaluated inter-alia may include outlook on the sector, parentage, quality of management, and overall financial strength of the credit. The AMC utilises ratings of. recognized rating agencies as an input in the credit evaluation. process. Investments in bonds and debenture are usually in instruments that have been assigned high investment grade ratings by a recognized rating agency. In line with SEBI Circular No. MFD/CIR/9/120/ 2000.dated. November 24, 2000, the AMC may constitute committee(s) to approve proposals for investments in unrated instruments. The. AMC Board and the Trustee shall approve the detailed parameters for such investments. The details of such investmentswould be communicated by the AMC to the Trustee in their periodical reports. It would also be clearly mentioned in the reports, how the parameters have been complied with. However, in case any security does not fall under the parameters, the prior approval of Board of AMC and Trustee shall be. Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to sell / liquidate a security at short notice at prevailing market prices or without incurring impact cost. While government bonds, money market instruments and shorter maturity instruments are generally easier to sell, corporate bonds and other instruments typically face higher liquidity. risk. Further, higher rated securities normally are more liquid compared to lower rated securities. As a result, different portfolios will face different levels of liquidity risk based on the underlying portfolio composition. Some of the strategies to reduce liquidity risk are creating portfolios that are diversified across maturities, ratings, types of securities, etc. in line with the fund objectives, regulations and investment strategy. Credit Risk:Lower rated securities have a higher credit risk compared to higher rated securities. Hence, credit risk faced by different schemes will be different based on the underlying portfolio / investment strategy. To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in-depth credit evaluation of each issuer will be undertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Each of the scheme/ portfolio will endeavour to maintain adequate diversification across issuers / sectors in line with scheme objectives, regulations and investment strategy. Unrated investments, if any, would require specific approval from committee constituted for the purpose. Debt Derivatives Risk: The AMC has provision for using derivative instruments for portfolio balancing and hedging. purposes. Interest Rate Swaps will be done with approved counter parties under pre approved ISDA agreements. Mark to Market of swaps, netting off of cash flow and default provision clauses will be provided as per standard practice on a reciprocal basis. Interest Rate Swaps and other derivative instruments will be used as per local (RBI and SEBI) regulatory guidelines. Interest Rate Risk:Interest rate risk is the risk of change in the NAVs due to change in overall market yields. The change in value of a security, for a given change in yield, is higher for a security with higher duration and vice versa. Hence portfolios with higher duration will have higher. volatility. The AMC shall strive to actively manage the duration of the respective funds based on the prevailing market conditions / outlook of interest rates, keeping in mind the scheme objectives, investment strategy and applicable regulations. Concentration Risk: The AMC will attempt to mitigate this risk by maintaining adequate diversification across issuers/ sectors / instrument type in line with the scheme objectives, investment strategy and applicable regulations. This will also be managed by keeping prudent investment limits. on any particular industry or issuer or issuer group based on the size, credit profile, etc. to reduce issuer or industry specific risk. Risk Mitigation measures for investments in Non-Convertible. Preference Shares: Credit Risk - To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in-depth credit evaluation of each issuer will be undertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). Liquidity Risk - The Fund endeavours to invest in preference shares of those companies which have relatively better market acceptability amongst market participants that increases the probability of secondary sale in case an exit from the investment is required. Unsecured in nature - The Fund endeavours to mitigate this risk by exercising due diligence while assessing the business, financial and management risks of the company before investing. While these measures are expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance that these risks would be completely eliminated. Strategies for Investment in Derivatives as per derivative strategy of the Scheme. Basic Structure of an Index Future. Index Futures are instruments designed to give exposure to the equity market indices. BSE Limited and the National Stock. Exchange of India Limited have started trading in index futures of 1, 2.and 3.month maturities. The pricing of an index future is the function of the underlying index and short term interest. Example: Assumptions: 1.month BSE 30.Future. Spot Index: 4900. Future Price on day 1: 4920. Fund buys 10,000.futures contracts.                                                                       strategy of taking a long position in index futures increases the exposure to the market. The long position is positively correlated with the market. However, there is no assurance that the stocks in the portfolio and the index behave in the same manner and thus this strategy may not provide gains perfectly aligned to the movement in the index. The long position will have as much loss / gain as in the underlying index. e.g. if the index appreciates by 10%, the index future value rises by 10%. However, this is true. On Date of settlement. Future price = Closing spot price = 4950. Profits for the Fund = (4950-4920)10000.= Rs. 300,000.+ interest for the 1.month period. Please note that the above example is given for illustration purposes only. The net impact for the Fund will be in terms of the difference between the closing price of the index and cost price (ignoring margins for the sake of simplicity) plus interest costs on funds that would otherwise be invested in stocks comprising the. index. The risks associated with index futures are similar to those associated with equity investments. Additional risks could be on account of illiquidity and/or mis pricing of the future at any time during the life of the contract. The strategies below are given for illustration purposes only. Some of the strategies involving derivatives that may be used by the Investment Manager, with an aim to protect capital and enhance returns include : Strategy Number 1. Using Index Futures to increase percentage investment in equities. This strategy will be used for the purpose of generating returns on idle cash, pending its investment in equities. The Scheme is subject to daily flows. There may be a time lag between the inflow of funds and their deployment in. stocks. If so desired, the scheme would be able to take immediate exposure to equities via index futures. The position in index futures may be reversed in a phased manner, as the funds are deployed in the equity markets. Example: The scheme has a corpus of Rs. 50.crore and there is an inflow of Rs. 5.crore in a day. The AMC may buy index futures contracts of a value of Rs. 5.crore. Later as the money is deployed in the underlying equities, the value of the index futures contracts can be suitably reduced. quoted price of the futures contract may be different from the gain/ loss due to the movement of the underlying. index. This is called the basis risk. While futures markets are typically more liquid than the underlying cash market, there can be no assurance that ready liquidity would exist at all points in time, for the. Scheme to purchase or close out a specific futures contract. Strategy Number 2. Downside Protection Using Stock Put. As a stock hedging strategy, the purchase of a put option on an underlying stock held would lead to a capping of the loss in value of the stock in the event of a material decline in the stocks price. The purchase of a put option against a stock holding in the scheme gives the scheme the option of selling the stock to the writer of the put at the predetermined level of the Put Option, called the strike price. If the stock falls below this level, the downside for the scheme is protected as it has already locked into the selling price. In case of a fall in the stocks price below the strike price, the value of the Put Option appreciates, approximately corresponding to the extent of the stocks price fall below the strike price. Example: Let us assume 20000.shares of XYZ Limited held in the portfolio with a market value of Rs. 1000.per share (overall Rs. 2.crores). The scheme purchases put options on the stock of XYZ Limited (not exceeding its holding of 20000.shares) with a strike price of Rs. 990.for an assumed cost (called Option Premium) of. Rs.per share (Rs. 3.lakhs for 20000.shares). By purchasing the above Put Option, the scheme has effectively set a floor to the realisation from the stock at Rs. 975.per share. (Rs. 990.strike price less Rs. 15.Option Premium paid). In case the stock price of the company falls below Rs. 975.per share, the gain in the price of the Put Option when added to the actual market price of the stock would bring the sale realisation per share close to Rs. 975.per share. After purchasing the above Put Option, in case the price of the stock appreciates, remains around Rs. 1000.or declines slightly to remain above the strike price, the scheme may not avail of the option and the cost for having bought the option remains fixed at Rs. 15.per share. In effect, a floor (in this case effectively Rs. 975) is set to the stock by buying an Option at a cost that is known (in this case. Rs. 15.per share).                                                                         can be no assurance that ready liquidity would exist at all points in time, for the scheme to purchase or close out a specific options contract. hedging strategy using Put Options is a perfect hedge on the expiration date of the put option. On other days, there may be (temporary) imperfect correlation between the share price and the put option. Strategy Number 3. Using Call option on Index to increase percentage investment in equities. This strategy will be used for the purpose of participating in the upside of the market. Example: Suppose, the Scheme has a corpus of Rs. 100.crore and the. Scheme on January 31, 2019.buys upto maximum 20% of the net assets into Index call option wherein strike price of underlying benchmark index is 10,000.and the premium on each call option for expiry after 3.years i.e. February 1, 2022.was at Rs. 2,000. Based on the above strategy the net assets of the Scheme will be as under: Option premium paid is to take an additional exposure of around Rs. 100.crores of equities. Therefore, the total exposure to equity assets due to the said strategy will be around Rs. 170.crores (i.e. Rs. 70.crores + Rs. 100.crores). Assuming the market index goes up the value of call option will increase. Thus, one can participate in the upside of the market as shown in the table below. Thus, the gain on the above strategy for the Scheme will be. Rs. 400.(Rs. 2,400.- Rs. 2,000) on each call option. RISKS. The strategy of taking a long position in index call option increases the exposure to the market. The long position is positively correlated with the market. However, there is no assurance that the stocks in the portfolio and the index behave in the same manner and thus this strategy may not provide gains perfectly aligned to the movement in the index. The risk/downside, if the market falls/remains flat is only limited to the option premium paid. The long position will have as much loss / gain as in the underlying index. For e.g. if the index appreciates by 10%, the index options value rises by 10%. However, this is true only for options held till maturity. While option markets are typically less liquid than the underlying cash market, hence there can be no assurance that ready liquidity would exist at all points in time, for the Scheme to purchase or close out a specific contract. Strategy Number 4. Using Put option on Index to minimize downside in equities. This strategy will be used for the purpose of hedging against downside in the market and capping the maximum loss in such a scenario. Example: Suppose, the Scheme has a corpus of Rs 100.crore and the. Scheme on January 31, 2019.buys 6% of the net assets into. At-the-money Index put option wherein strike price of underlying benchmark index having expiry February 1, 2022.index put option is Rs 10,000, bought at a premium of Rs. 600. Based on the above strategy the net assets of the Scheme will be as under: Option premium paid is to take downside exposure to. Rs 94.crore in underlying benchmark index. Therefore, the total exposure to long equities is Rs 94.crore and participation in downside of underlying benchmark index is Rs 94.crore through the option. Thus, the gain on the above strategy for the Scheme will be. Rs. 400.(Rs. 1,000.- Rs. 600) on each call option.                                                                        strategy of taking a long position in index put option hedges a portfolio of long only stocks/funds against potential markets falls. The long position in the put option is negatively correlated with the market. However, there is no assurance that the stocks in the portfolio and the index behave in the same manner and thus this strategy may not provide gains perfectly aligned to the movement in the index. The risk/downside, if the index remains above the strike price is only limited to the option premium paid. The premium paid is the maximum downside to the portfolio. There is positive return in the put strategy only if the index falls below the strike price. The long position will have as much loss / gain as the reverse of the underlying index. For e.g. if the index depreciates by 10%, the index options value rises by 10%. However, this is true only for options held till maturity. While option markets are typically less liquid than the underlying cash market, there can be no assurance that ready liquidity would exist at all points in time, for the. Scheme to purchase or close out a specific contract. In terms of Circular No. MFD.BC.191/07.279/1999-2000. and MPD.BC.187/07.279/1999-2000.dated November 1, 1999.and July 7, 1999.respectively issued by Reserve Bank of India, Mutual Funds are permitted participation in Interest. Rate Swaps and Forward Rate Agreements. These products. were introduced for deepening the countrys money market. The Scheme may trade in these instruments for the purpose of hedging and portfolio balancing or to undertake any other strategy as permitted under SEBI (MF) Regulations from time to time. SEBI has also permitted trading of interest rate derivatives through Stock Exchange. Strategies for Investment in Debt Derivatives as per derivative strategy of Scheme. RBI and SEBI over the years vide various circulars have permitted. Mutual Funds to participate in Interest Rate Swaps, Forward. Rate Agreements and Interest Rate Futures. These products were introduced for deepening the countrys debt and money. markets. The Scheme may trade in these instruments or any new instrument permitted by SEBI for the purpose of hedging and portfolio balancing or to undertake any other strategy as permitted under SEBI (MF) Regulations from time to time. SEBI has also permitted trading of interest rate derivatives through. Stock Exchange. Interest Rate Swaps (IRS). All swaps are financial contracts, which involve exchange. (swap) of a set of payments owned by one party for another set of payments owned by another party, usually through an intermediary (market maker). An IRS can be defined as a contract between two parties (Counter Parties) to exchange, on particular dates in the future, one series of cash flows, (fixed. interest) for another series of cashflows (variable or floating. interest) in the same currency and on the same principal for an agreed period of time. The exchange of cashflows need not occur on the same date. It may be noted that in such hedged positions (fixed v/s floating or vice versa), both legs of the transactions have interest rate volatility as underlying. Basic Structure of a Swap. Assume that the Scheme has a Rs. 20.crore floating rate investment linked to FBIL (Financial Benchmarks India Private. Ltd) : Overnight MIBOR (Mumbai Inter Bank Offered Rate). Hence, the Scheme is currently running an interest rate risk and stands to lose if the interest rate moves down. To hedge this interest rate risk, the Scheme can enter into a 6.month. MIBOR swap. Through this swap, the Scheme will receive a fixed predetermined rate (assume 7%) and pays the benchmark rate (MIBOR), which is fixed by the FBIL or any other agency such as Reuters,etc. This swap would effectively lock-in the rate of 7% for the next 6.months, eliminating the daily interest rate. The steps will be as follows -. Assuming the swap is for Rs. 20.crore June 1, 2019.to. December 1, 2019. The Scheme is a fixed rate receiver at 7% and the counterparty is a floating rate receiver at the overnight rate on a compounded basis (say MIBOR). On June 1, 2019.the Scheme and the counterparty will exchange only a contract of having entered this swap. This documentation would be as per International Swap Dealers. Association (ISDA). On a daily basis, the benchmark rate fixed by FBIL will be tracked by them. On December 1, 2019.they will calculate the following-. The Scheme is entitled to receive interest on Rs. 20. crore at 7% for 183.days i.e. Rs. 0.crore, (this amount is known at the time the swap was concluded) and will pay the compounded benchmark rate. The counterparty is entitled to receive daily compounded. MIBOR rate for 183.days & pay 7% fixed. On December 1, 2019, if the total interest on the daily overnight compounded benchmark rate is higher than. Rs. 0.crore, the Scheme will pay the difference to the counterparty. If the daily compounded benchmark rate is lower, then the counterparty will pay the Scheme the difference. Effectively the Scheme earns interest at the rate of 7% p.a. for six months without lending money for 6.months fixed, while the counterparty pays interest @ 7% p.a. for 6.months on Rs. 20.crore, without borrowing for 6.months. The above example illustrates the benefits and risks of using derivatives for hedging and optimizing the investment portfolio. Swaps have their own drawbacks like credit risk, settlement. risk. However, these risks are substantially reduced as the amount involved is interest streams and not principal. Forward Rate Agreement. FRA is an agreement between two counter parties to pay or to receive the difference between an agreed fixed rate (the. FRA rate) and the interest rate prevailing on a stipulated future date, based on a notional amount, for an agreed period. In short, in a FRA, interest rate is fixed now for a future period. The special feature of FRAs is that the only payment is the difference between the FRA rate and the Reference rate and hence are single settlement contracts. As in the case of IRS, notional amounts are not exchanged. Assume that on December 1, 2019, the 30.day commercial paper (CP) rate is 7.75% and the Scheme has an investment in a CP of face value Rs. 25.crores, which is going to mature on December 30, 2019. If the fund managers view is that the interest rates are likely to remain stable or decline after. December 30, 2019, and if the fund manager, wants to re- deploy the maturity proceeds for 1.more month and does not want to take the risk of interest rates going down, he can then enter into a following forward rate agreement (FRA) say as on. December 1, 2019: He can receive 1.X 2.FRA at 7.75% (FRA rate in 1.month time for 1.months lending) on the notional amount of Rs. 25.crores, with a reference rate of 30.day CP benchmark. If the CP benchmark on the settlement date i.e. December 30, 2019.falls to 7.50%, then the Scheme receives the present value of 25.bps (7.75% - 7.50%) on the notional amount Rs. 25.crores for 1.month. The maturity proceeds are then reinvested at say. 7.50% (close to the benchmark). The scheme, however, would have locked in the rate prevailing on December 1, 2019. (7.75%) as it would have received 25.basis points on Rs. 25. cr as settlement amount from FRA. Thus the fund manager can use FRA to mitigate the reinvestment risk. In this example, if the rates move up by 25.basis points to 8% on the settlement date (December 30, 2019), the Scheme loses 25.basis points on Rs. 25.cr for 1.month, but since the reinvestment will then happen at 8%, effective returns for the. Scheme is unchanged at 7.75%, which is the prevailing rate on December 1, 2019. Interest Rate Futures (IRFs): An Interest Rate Futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a debt instrument at a specified future date at a price that is fixed today. The underlying security for Interest Rate Futures is either Government Bond, T-Bill or any other permitted benchmark security. IRFs contracts are cash settled. Holders of the fixed income securities are exposed to the risk of rising interest rates, which in turn results in the reduction in the value of their portfolio. So in order to protect against fall in the value of their portfolio due to falling bond prices, they can take short position in IRF contracts. Example: Date: 15/12/2019. Spot price of GOI Security: Rs 105. May Futures price of IRF Contract: Rs 105. On 15/12/2019.ABC bought 2000.GOI securities from spot market at Rs 105. He anticipates that the interest rate will rise in near future. Therefore to hedge the exposure in underlying market he may sell December 2019.Interest Rate Futures contracts at Rs 105. On 30/12/2019.due to increase in interest rate: Spot price. Profit in the Futures market will be (104.: 105.12)2000.= Rs 1,680. Imperfect Hedging using IRF. IRF can be taken at portfolio level to reduce the interest rate risk of the portfolio or part of the portfolio (including one or more securities). However, in case the IRF used for hedging the interest rate risk has different underlying security(s) than the existing position being hedged, it would result in imperfect hedging ie basis risk. In order to reduce the basis risk for the portfolio hedging strategy, the correlation between the portfolio or part of the portfolio (excluding the hedged portions, if any) and the IRF would be atleast 0.at the time of initiation of. hedge. The correlation should be calculated for a period of last 90.days. Additionally, Imperfect hedging using IRFs would. Date: 15/06/2019. Total Assets of the Scheme: Rs. 100.cr. Modified Duration of the Scheme: 4. August 2019.Future Price of IRF contract of 6.GOI 2029: Modified Duration of 6.GOI 2029: 7. Correlation between IRF and Portfolio during last 90.days: On 15/06/2019, the fund manager anticipates that the interest rates will rise in near future. Therefore, to hedge the exposures of the portfolio he sells 19,00,000.IRF contracts of August 2019. 6.GOI 2029.at 103. Thus, the value of Futures contract is Rs. 19.cr, which is less than 20% of Scheme value. On 15/07/2019, due to interest rate increase by 5.basis points, the values of securities in the portfolio reduced to Rs. 99.cr and the price of IRF contract for August 2019.79. GOI 2029.reduced to Rs. 102.. This resulted in loss in the value of the securities of Rs. 0.cr (Rs. 100.cr - Rs. 99. cr) and profit in the futures position of Rs. 0.cr {(103.24-. Given that there was imperfect correlation between portfolio and the IRF (ie basis risk) as well as cap on the maximum portfolio hedging allowed as per extant regulation, the loss in the value of portfolio was not completely matched by the gain from the IRF contract. Nevertheless, the fund manager was able to protect the value of the portfolio, to an extent, using the IRF contract. The loss on proportionate basis (ie ~20% of portfolio) would have been only Rs. 0.cr as against gain of Rs. 0.cr of gain from IRF. Risk Factors of SWAP/ Forward Rate Agreement (FRA)/. Interest Rate Futures (IRF). Credit Risk: This is the risk of defaults by the counterparty. This is usually negligible, as there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative transaction. Market Risk: Market movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives. Liquidity Risk: The risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due to lack of liquidity in the market. Additional Risk viz. Basis Risk associated with imperfect hedging using Interest Rate Futures (IRF): The imperfect correlation between the prices of securities in the portfolio and the IRF contract used to hedge part of the portfolio leads to basis risk. Thus, the loss on the portfolio may not exactly match the gain from the hedge position entered using the IRF. PORTFOLIO                                                        Scheme is an open-ended Scheme. It is expected that there would be a number of subscriptions and redemptions on a daily basis.
