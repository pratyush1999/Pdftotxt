RegTech as a term is self-explanatory : its technology that helps fnancial services frms get better at dealing with regulation. As a key element of fnancial institutions drive towards digital transformation, RegTech promises to: Strengthen compliance and mitigate risk. Reduce the fxed cost of compliance and increase effciency. Improve protection for customers. Provide valuable business insight. Provide customers with better and faster service. Drive new products and services. We are not there yet - in fact, if the RegTech industry were mountain wed only be at base camp. This article maps out. RegTechs potential for transformation while staying rooted in the reality of where we are now and what is immediately round the corner. You can join the RegTech revolution now.. sector under pressure. Financial institutions have faced an ever-increasing regulatory burden over the past 10.years. The cost of compliance has surged, particularly for global companies operating across jurisdictions. RegTech is one of the fastest- growing elements of fntech/fnancial. innovation. RegTech uses technologies such as advanced analytics, robotic process automation, cognitive computing and the cloud to achieve regulatory and compliance outcomes more effciently and effectively. Shareholders want management to show they can meet regulatory demands without throwing more resources at the problem. The wider market is challenging. Margins are slim, interest rates remain low, competition is intense and political uncertainty is feeding economic and fnancial market volatility. Financial institutions are turning to RegTech to fll compliance gaps, reduce costs, get ahead of requirements and detect enterprise risk before the regulators.. It is easy to get carried away with new technologies that ultimately dont. deliver. Most fnancial companies use of RegTech is in its infancy and obstacles lie in the way. But RegTech has the potential to improve service and protection for customers and to help restore trust in the industry. By 2020.RegTech is expected to make up 34% of all regulatory spending. $270bn.

Where are we now?. From KYC to know your data. RegTech is not a new category but : like other applications of technology : it is developing rapidly, driven by increases in computing power, the falling cost of emerging tech and the data. explosion. We can divide RegTechs history into three phases: RegTech 1.was the period in the 1990s and 2000s when fnancial institutions began introducing new technologies to monitor and analyse risks of specifc regulations or. processes. These developed into some of the quantitative risk management practices that were familiar with today.. Over the past decade. RegTech 2.tools have helped companies to comply with rules and improve their supervision. activities. Most RegTech applications have focused on know your customer (KYC) by improving consumer protection and challenging bad behaviours. The industry is now on the verge of RegTech 3.: a move from know your customer to know your data as fnancial institutions start to view risk and regulation as data and prediction problems that can be addressed by technology. Technologies such as artifcial intelligence and machine learning can enable companies to move from big data to smart data to gain insights into regulatory practices, automate complex reporting, conduct meaningful analysis of critical compliance risk areas and even potentially create an end-to-end  view of compliance. Companies are using RegTech to deal with the huge amount of data they are generating. More data handled the right way also means better information and can provide an upside for risk and compliance. Where will these technologies come from? Startups are mushrooming and fnancial services companies have become more active in developing processes and protecting their intellectual property. Leading fnancial institutions have applied for more patents on an increasingly impressive range of innovative products. But in-house 1.       focuses on products and services rather than RegTech - and the fnancial sector lags way behind the big technology companies. As noted earlier, the worlds 15.largest banks together own fve times fewer fntech patents (4,697) than the biggest single technology company (23,864)10. Tech companies patents are not restricted to consumer-friendly 2.        innovations: they include credit checking, security and authentication. institutions shareholders. Companies should view Regtech as part of the wider digital transformation process that the industry is grappling with. While most institutions have built digital front-ends for their are built on legacy systems. Digital transformation requires rethink of the whole business model and a redesign that spans the middle and back offce as well as the front offce : including risk and compliance. When it comes to investing in fntech and RegTech, fnancial institutions can be broadly considered as falling into three categories: defensive, progressive and reinvention. These categories dovetail with the three Cs : compliance, cost and complexity : that are driving RegTech adoption.. Defensive, progressive or reinvention?. Defensive companies are concerned mainly with meeting regulatory. requirements. Measures of success include keeping up with regulatory change, optimising capital and minimising conduct risk and investigations by regulators. Progressive companies have moved on to seeking effciencies and customer benefts by automating some processes, making commercial investments and working with third parties to turn rhetoric about putting customers frst into reality. Reinvention requires the company to become an IP organization by bringing in senior managers, ideas and processes from other industries. The company will have its own innovation and commercial culture embedded. As RegTech 3.beckons, all the three Cs are on fnancial institutions agendas but those still in defensive mode are most focused on compliance while progressive frms have made the move to deal with costs. A few global investment banks have entered the reinvention phase that enables them to seek solutions to complexity and uncertainty and make the transition to become data companies. The three Cs. Compliance. The pace of regulatory change has slowed but compliance requirements will continue to grow as regulators focus on reforms ranging from supervision to systemic risk and priorities spanning data privacy and consumer protection. Cost. Regulatory constraints and low interest rates have made it harder for fnancial institutions to generate consistent proft growth. Financial institutions need to reduce cost will see them embrace technology which enables them to increase effciency and productivity in the risk and compliance function. As the cost of hardware and software comes down, investment in RegTech will become ever more affordable. Complexity. Political events are creating global uncertainties as the fnancial sector seeks to navigate new products, services and regulations. Added to these factors is the complexity created by the data environment, legacy systems and operating models. Theres a revolution coming. RegTech is on the cusp of a breakthrough that has the potential to transform the industrys approach to compliance and create additional. value. The potential for RegTech 3.is backed by support from regulators, impetus for digital change, growing levels of investment and a proliferation of startups seeking to meet demand alongside big tech companies. Regulators are also looking at how they can apply technology to their own processes. The Financial. Conduct Authority is exploring how technology can make it more effcient and relieve the burden on frms. It has sought the views of frms and holds events to explore potential innovations. In the future, companies should expect mandatory requirements for tech that lets regulators scrutinize their data more effectively. You dont have to believe the hype : or have made the move to our reinvention category : to adopt RegTech to deal with immediate issues and improve your business. Here are some real-world examples, including projects we have worked on, of improvements using RegTech: multinational bank needed to demonstrate control of its inventory management system to regulators and eliminate spreadsheet errors. The bank deployed a RegTech system to automate the regulatory process, gain a complete view of its spreadhseets and save time and money. The services cover policies ranging from regulatory to internal policy as well as identifying other control issues such as operational incidents. Combining workfow automation and robotics with advanced analytics, a European bank automated credit decisions to reduce approval time for existing customers from two days to few minutes. The number of credit offce employees required to handle the transactions halved as a result : and customers received better, faster service. bank used robotics to record the maturities of products when trades were executed and loans were made. Before, three parties would enter different categories of information on a manual spreadsheet in a highly ineffcient process. Robotics and workfow technology enabled the bank to complete work in less than an hour that had previously taken fve days. To combat fnancial crime, a bank wanted scalable solution to review 400,000.SME customers, gain a holistic view of risk and establish a robust audit trail. The company adopted a cloud-based solution that halved the time required for a customer review, improved monitoring of fnancial crime and enhanced the banks understanding of customers business activities. There are obstacles that could impede companies willingness to invest in RegTech and innovators abilities to develop the solutions that meet the industrys needs. These include: changing regulatory landscape that means costly investment in technology might not meet compliance requirements down the line. The diffculty for fnancial services frms in assessing the possibilities from an increasing array of new technologies and startups. The absence of a common framework for handling complex data across borders lack of common networks and collaboration platforms to bring together regulatory experts, software developers and fnancial institutions.
