This trend is expected to continue, with India estimated to become the third largest global economy by 2030.1 While the percentage of wealthy individuals in India is very small compared with developed markets, forecasted growth figures point toward a very high potential for asset accumulation over the foreseeable future. India's wealthy are relatively young compared with their international counterparts and, hence, take a different approach to wealth management. India's wealth management services sector is largely fragmented, which isn't surprising given the industry is still in its early days. While early entrants and established local players have gained trust with potential investors, firms looking to enter the market will need to invest heavily in brand-building exercises to convey their trustworthiness. Hence, it is rec- ommended that firms take a long-term view while evaluating potential return on investment. The regulatory environment in the Indian wealth management space is evolving, presenting oppor- tunities for established wealth managers to expand their offerings. Regulations covering fiduciary duties and investor protection are imminent. The changing tax regime in every annual budget cycle is adding some uncertainty, which could poten- tially change product offerings dramatically. Also, overall HNWI liquid assets (when measured as a percentage of Indian GDP) are increasing at a healthy pace, indicating the expansion of investable wealth in the economy (see Figure 2). This has caused an increase in liquid assets available for organized wealth management players, which has contributed to their growth in assets under management. This is a lucrative segment for the Indian wealth management industry. For example, the total number of NRI and people of Indian origin (PIO) is estimated at 29 million globally, with a combined wealth estimated at USD $1 trillion. Remittances to India reached a figure of USD $55 billion in 2010.7 It is estimated that about 45% of these remittances are invested in banks and real estate in India. These flows were a result of corruption, criminal activities and efforts to conceal wealth from the country's tax authorities. HNWIs and private companies were found to be the primary drivers of illicit flows out of India's private sector. The present value of India's total illicit financial flows (IFFs) is estimated to be at least $462 billion11 (see Figure 4). In recent times, the Indian government has redoubled its efforts to curb these leaks from the economy. If successful, these efforts could result in discouraging future illicit outflows from the financial system. In 1997, the government introduced a Voluntary Disclosure of Income (VDIS) scheme, allowing individuals to convert black money into white by paying taxes on previously undeclared income. Similar targeted measures may be taken in the future, rechanneling previously undisclosed wealth into the mainstream. Over 70% of Indian HNWIs are under 50 years of age, with a majority between 31-50 years (see Figure 5). India's booming services industry is among the driving forces behind the creation of a large affluent population in the past decade. IT and IT-enabled services, which form the majority of these growth industries, employ a workforce that is primarily under 35 years of age. The accelerated growth of these industries has led to rapid wealth creation among the young urban workforce. The younger demographic dis- tribution calls for different types of investment objectives and service levels (see Figure 6). In addition, a number of factors - including a series of high-profile scams, detrimental practices of advisors with a short-term view and the lack of a strong inves- tor protection environment - have contributed to investor insecurity. This is the primary reason for Indian investors taking a myopic view towards investments, largely discarding the option of long-term investments and personal retirement planning unless offered as an additional tax savings instrument. A number of wirehouses are launching wealth management services, aiming to gain greater wallet share by cross-selling. In the short term, the industry will remain fragmented, with a large number of broker-dealers, sub-bro- kers, financial advisors, insurance agents and tax consultants offering wealth management services (see Figure 7). Given the industry's embryonic stage, consolidation or M&A activity is limited. It is estimated that about 20% of the Indian HNWI population lives outside ma- jor metros and is still served by unorganized players. Therefore, the reach of wealth man- agement firms will play a very important role in capturing available wealth and converting it to assets under management. The wealth management model is based on a high-touch client relationship, and, therefore, establishing a physical presence is critical. However with the sharp increase in real estate prices during the past decade, establishing a brick-and-mor- tar model has become cost-prohibitive for new entrants. Hence, firms need to take a long-term view and expect an extended payback period. Another barrier for new entrants is trust in investors. Given India's unfortunate history of financial scams, there exists a general sense of mistrust and wariness among investors. Establishing trust is a vital component for any successful brand-building exercise in India. However, the sophistication and breadth of products is still limited, compared with the choices offered by players in mature markets. Mutual funds sponsored by private sector entities were allowed to enter the Indian market, introducing competition within the mutual fund industry and resulting in the introduction of new products and improvement of services. Exchange traded financial derivatives were introduced in India at the two major stock exchanges, NSE and BSE. There are various contracts currently traded on these exchanges. The National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange Limited (NCDEX) and MCX (Multi Commodity Exchange) started operations, to provide a platform for commodities trading. First Gold Exchange Traded Fund started. Exchange traded interest rate derivatives introduced. Options in currency derivatives launched. The complexity of designing innovative products in a more restric- tive regulatory environment - as well as maintain- ing product structure and pricing transparency - will be key challenges. Recent trends indicate that local players are teaming up with specialists from developed markets to enhance their product and service offerings. Develop- ing and retaining highly qualified advisors will be critical for organizations, as this is the key differ- entiator for leaders vs. laggards. Another force with the potential to change market dynamics is the entry of public sector banks into the wealth management market. While they haven't been aggressive yet, their entry into the fray is inevitable. The limited range of investment products offered is largely due to the cautious approach adopted by Indian regulatory bodies. India's fixed income, commodities and derivatives markets have not kept pace with its equities markets in terms of maturity. However, it is expected that the regulatory environment in India will evolve rapidly, in tune with market and investor needs (see Figure 8 for a list of regulatory changes in the securities trading space). Fiduciary duty and investor protection. We also expect data privacy-relat- ed rules and guidelines to become stricter. These changes will impose higher training costs, as well as investments in processes and IT for compliance (disclosure/reporting, data security, etc.). The Securities and Exchanges Board of India (SEBI) recently announced plans to set up a self-regulatory model for the wealth manage- ment industry along the lines of AMFI (Asso- ciation of Mutual Funds in India) and AMBI (Association of Merchant Bankers in India). It has been proposed that the new organization, once formed, will act as a regulator, as well as a market development authority. Tax rules are evolving and are set to change, which might affect investor behavior. This, in turn, may drive greater product innovation. Wealth management organizations will need to be flexible to continuously adapt and ensure that they can suitably tap into any market opportuni- ties created by such changes. For wealth management firms seeking to grow their business in the Indian market, overcoming the trust barrier is the greatest impediment for building a strong brand. Widespread mistrust can be attributed to the spate of dishonest practices, which for years have reverberated across the financial services space. Promotion of investor education can help in long-term relationship building. Greater financial awareness will also help in informed decision making and will reduce the chances of fraud. Investor education programs could deliver information pertaining to various asset classes and the associated risks, fee structures and benefits of each. Programs must be tailored, allowing for differences in the maturity and experience levels of investors. In addition, programs should cover common fraudulent practices rampant in the industry and include precautionary measures that investors could take to avoid falling victim to such practices. Investments in advisor training and qualifica- tion will be vital for firms looking to stay ahead in the game, as advisors are the primary touch- points for investors. Well-trained advisors are especially critical in high-touch relationships in the case of ultra high net worth individual (UHNWI) clients. Given that regulations sur- rounding advisor qualifications, data privacy and fiduciary duties are inevitable in the not so distant future, companies that invest early in adopting these practices and train advisors ahead of others can win customers' trust and advisors' loyalty. Qualified advisors will be the best brand ambassadors for new firms seeking to gain a competitive edge against established players. Given the large number of firms entering the wealth management market in India, and the inevita- bility of public sector banks launching wealth management services, the shortage of quality financial advisors is expected to be more acute than ever. Additionally, firms will need to work out a retention strategy for their advisors as demand of resources rapidly exceeds supply. Moreover, increased attrition leads to higher recruitment costs. Investing in advisor technology can help address these issues to a large extent. Superior advisor technology has the potential to greatly enhance advisor productivity, by minimizing the time spent on administra- tive and compliance activities, thus allowing advisors to better focus on client servicing. Advisor platforms that offer lead management, portfolio management, financial profiling, asset allocation and transaction management capabilities can integrate multiple touch- points and improve advisor experience. A 360-degree solution serves to aggregate critical improve advisor customer data and saves experience. Mobility solutions provide wealth management firms with the ability to conduct business in locations that are not covered by the branch network. They also provide financial advisors with the flexibil- ity to work from anywhere and provide them critical information on a real-time basis. Also, as the target segment in India is fairly young and fluent in the use of technology, mobility solutions will help avoid situations where the customer is better aware than the advisor, con- tributing to higher customer satisfaction. Increase reach through smart use of part- nering and technology. Customers demand flexibility in how, where and when they access desired information and a deeper understanding of alternatives before making final investment decisions. Wealth management firms need to provide sophis- ticated analytics and decision making tools to equip these individuals with the insights required to fulfill their investment needs. This will also help in investor education and contribute to brand-building efforts. However, making this happen will require a great deal of due diligence from both parties and will extend time to market. Financial advisory regulations are still under the purview of the Ministry of Finance. However, to create a more comprehensive reg- ulatory environment, all regulators will have to work together to address a variety of dis- tribution segments, from service pensions and insurance, through investments and wealth management. This is particularly impor- tant given the significant flux in regulations aimed at protecting investor interest in recent years. Wealth management firms offering services in India will need to build flexibil- ity into their operating models and processes in order to adapt to frequent changes in the regulatory landscape. Advisors tend to push products that earn higher commissions under the current framework and recommend frequent portfolio churns to increase the number of transactions, leaving clients feeling cheated. Moreover, with regulators stepping up vigilance and com- missions heading south, this model will soon be unsustainable. Shifting to a profit-sharing model (where the advisor's fees are based on the overall performance of the portfolio) would help mitigate these issues to some extent. Firms will need to innovate to create attractive product offerings within the evolving regulatory environment. For example, changing tax rules have the potential to render many popular products obsolete. In addition, anticipating investor needs and addressing them proac- tively will be the key to carving out a niche in a market that is expected to grow more crowded over time. For example, while the "retirement segment" is not big in Indian markets today, the focus on retirement planning is expected to grow in coming years. Consistent, well- performing products in this segment will help in gaining an early market share. Investable assets > $1 million. This provides exciting growth opportunities which will drive rapid market expansion, coupled with an increase in the number of industry participants. To successfully tap into this potential, financial services organizations must undertake a customized approach, taking into account the specific attributes of the Indian market. This will need to be supported by a robust and cost-effec- tive business model focused on improved trans- parency and compliance, synergistic partnerships and efficient technology solutions.
