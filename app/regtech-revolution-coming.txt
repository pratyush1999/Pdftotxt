Introduction
RegTech as a term is self-explanatory –
it’s technology that helps fnancial services frms
get better at dealing with regulation. As a key
element of fnancial institutions’ drive towards
digital transformation, RegTech promises to:

   Strengthen compliance and mitigate risk
   Reduce the fxed cost of compliance and increase effciency
   Improve protection for customers


But it can be more than that. Through direct improvements
and freeing resources, RegTech also has the potential to:


   Provide valuable business insight
   Provide customers with better and faster service
   Drive new products and services


We are not there yet - in fact, if the RegTech industry were
a mountain we’d only be at base camp. This article maps out
RegTech’s potential for transformation while staying rooted in
the reality of where we are now and what is immediately round
the corner. You can join the RegTech revolution now.

A sector under pressure
Financial institutions have faced an ever-increasing regulatory
burden over the past 10 years. The cost of compliance has surged,
particularly for global companies operating across jurisdictions.




       RegTech is one of the fastest-                                                                              The industry is also spending big on

       The wider market is challenging.
       Margins are slim, interest rates remain
       low, competition is intense and political
       uncertainty is feeding economic and
       fnancial market volatility.

       Financial institutions are turning
       to RegTech to fll compliance
       gaps, reduce costs, get ahead of
       requirements and detect enterprise
       risk before the regulators.

Technologies such as artifcial intelligence and machine
learning can enable companies to move from big data
to ‘smart data’ to gain insights into regulatory practices,
automate complex reporting, conduct meaningful analysis
of critical compliance risk areas and even potentially create
         - -
an end-to-end  view of compliance.

Companies are using RegTech to deal with the huge amount
of data they are generating. More data handled the right way
also means better information and can provide an upside for
risk and compliance.

Where will these technologies come from? Startups are
mushrooming and fnancial services companies have become
more active in developing processes and protecting their
intellectual property. Leading fnancial institutions have
applied for more patents on an increasingly impressive range
of innovative products. But in-house
                               -      innovation focuses on
products and services rather than RegTech - and the fnancial
sector lags way behind the big technology companies.

As noted earlier, the world’s 15 largest banks together own
fve times fewer fntech patents (4,697) than the biggest
single technology company (23,864)10. Tech companies’
patents are not restricted to consumer-friendly
                                        -        innovations:
they include credit checking, security and authentication.

Forward-looking   companies regard patents as an important
part of their innovation strategy. Investment in RegTech

and smart use of IP can unlock long-term   value for financial
institutions’ shareholders.

Companies should view Regtech as part of the wider digital
transformation process that the industry is grappling with.
                                                -
While most institutions have built digital front-ends for their

businesses, particularly in consumer-facing   markets, these
are built on legacy systems. Digital transformation requires
a rethink of the whole business model and a redesign that
spans the middle and back offce as well as the front offce –
including risk and compliance.

When it comes to investing in fntech and RegTech, fnancial
institutions can be broadly considered as falling into three
categories: defensive, progressive and reinvention. These
categories dovetail with the three Cs – compliance, cost and
complexity – that are driving RegTech adoption.

There’s a revolution coming
RegTech is on the cusp of a breakthrough that has the potential to
transform the industry’s approach to compliance and create additional
value. The potential for RegTech 3.0 is backed by support from regulators,
impetus for digital change, growing levels of investment and a proliferation
of startups seeking to meet demand alongside big tech companies.

Conclusion
RegTech 3.0 forms part of the
transition from defensive mode to
reinvention. Financial institutions
should think about RegTech as
part of their wider transformation
strategy and be clear about what
they want to achieve. Yes, the
potential is enormous but you can
start using RegTech to improve
your business now. And if not
RegTech then how are you going
to deal with the demands of
complexity, cost and compliance
in an environment that isn’t
getting any easier?
